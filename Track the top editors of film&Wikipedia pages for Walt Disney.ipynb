There are so many great movies, like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers, Black Panther, and many more. At this time, the quality of the content on the Disney movie page of Wikipedia is extremely important. I’ll use tools and methods to track the top editors of film, and Wikipedia pages for Walt Disney.\n  \n  The quality of the content on the Disney movie page of Wikipedia is extremely important. I would like to understand who the \"top\" Wikipedia film contributors are and build a dashboard around this for easy access by Data Analysis. Specifically, I want to know which users are most active in editing the Wikipedia pages for films. But let's take it a little further, I want to track the top editors for film pages and the Wikipedia pages that frequently link out to specific film pages as well (for example, Star Wars links to several film pages)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Elaboration/Implementtion of concept\n\nTo complete the project, I'll use Databricks which is a Unified Data Analytics Platform - One cloud platform for massive-scale data engineering and collaborative data science.

equivalent to 5 February 1675 using the [[Julian calendar]] with March 25 as New Year's Day</ref>]]  [[Physics]] (from the [[Ancient Greek]] φύσις ''[[physis]]'' meaning \"[[nature]]\") is the fundamental branch of [[science]] that developed out of the study of nature and [[philosophy]] known, until around the end of the 19th century, as \"[[natural philosophy]]\". Today, physics is ultimately defined as the study of [[matter]], [[energy]] and the relationships between them.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Physics is, in some senses, the oldest and most basic pure science; its discoveries find applications throughout the [[natural science]]s, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into [[classical physics]] and [[modern physics]].  == Ancient history == {{further|History of astronomy}}  Elements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[mechanics]], which were methodologically united through the study of [[geometry]]. These mathematical disciplines began in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] with the [[Babylonia]]ns and with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] writers such as [[Archimedes]] and [[Ptolemy]]. [[Ancient philosophy]], meanwhile&nbsp;– including what was called \"[[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]]\"&nbsp;– focused on explaining nature through ideas such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotle#Causality, the four causes|four types of \"cause\"]].  ===Ancient Greece=== The move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in Greece (650–480 [[BCE]]) with the [[Presocratics|Pre-Socratic philosophers]].  The philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed \"the Father of Science\" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural [[phenomenon|phenomena]], proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.<ref>\"This shift from ecclesiastical reasoning to scientific reasoning marked the beginning of scientific methodology.\" Singer, C., ''A Short History of Science to the 19th Century'',  Streeter Press, 2008, p. 35.</ref> Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is [[Arche|the basic element]], experimenting with the attraction between [[magnet]]s and rubbed [[amber]] and formulating the first recorded [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]. [[Anaximander]], famous for his proto-[[evolution]]ary theory, disputed the Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, [[Heraclitus]] proposed that the only basic law governing the [[Universe]] was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation made him one of the first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of [[time]] in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The early physicist [[Leucippus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] first half of the 5th century BCE) adamantly opposed the idea of direct [[Divine providence|divine intervention]] in the universe, proposing instead that natural phenomena had a natural cause. Leucippus and his student [[Democritus]] were the first to develop the theory of [[atomism]], the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s.  [[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Aristotle]]<br/>(384–322 [[BCE]])]]  During the [[Classical Greece|classical period]] in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], [[natural philosophy]] slowly developed into an exciting and contentious field of study. [[Aristotle]] ({{lang-el|Ἀριστοτέλης}}, ''Aristotélēs'') (384 – 322 BCE), a student of [[Plato]], promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them. Aristotle's writings cover physics, [[metaphysics]], [[poetry]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], [[politics]], [[government]], [[ethics]], [[biology]] and [[zoology]]. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as \"Physics\"&nbsp;– in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as [[Aristotelian physics]]. He attempted to explain ideas such as [[motion (physics)|motion]] (and [[gravity]]) with the theory of [[classical elements|four elements]]. Aristotle believed that all matter was made up of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the [[circumference]]. Eventually, [[Aristotelian physics]] became enormously popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the [[Middle Ages]]. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]].  Early in Classical Greece, knowledge that the Earth is [[Sphere|spherical]] (\"round\") was common. Around 240 BCE, as the result [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth's circumference|a seminal experiment]], [[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BCE) accurately estimated its circumference. In contrast to Aristotle's geocentric views, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] ({{lang-el|Ἀρίσταρχος}}; c.310&nbsp;– c.230 BCE) presented an explicit argument for a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], i.e. for placing the [[Sun]], not the [[Earth]], at its centre. [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a follower of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory, stated that [[Axial tilt|the Earth rotated around its own axis]], which, in turn, [[Orbit|revolved around]] the Sun. Though the arguments he used were lost, [[Plutarch]] stated that Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning.  [[File:Domenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg|thumb|180x|The ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]], famous for his ideas regarding [[fluid mechanics]] and [[buoyancy]].]]  In the 3rd century BCE, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] ({{lang-el|[[wikt:Ἀρχιμήδης|Ἀρχιμήδης]]}} (287–212 BCE)&nbsp;– generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time&nbsp;– laid the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and calculated the underlying mathematics of the [[lever]]. A leading scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The [[Archimedes' screw]] underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the [[First Punic War]]. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out that it was impossible to separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' Principle]]. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]]. He also defined the [[Archimedean spiral|spiral bearing his name]], formulae for the [[volume]]s of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the principles of equilibrium states and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]], ideas that would influence the well known scholars, Galileo, and Newton.  [[Hipparchus]] (190–120 BCE), focusing on astronomy and mathematics, used sophisticated geometrical techniques to map the motion of the stars and [[planet]]s, even predicting the times that [[Solar eclipse]]s would happen. In addition, he added calculations of the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, based upon his improvements to the observational instruments used at that time. Another of the most famous of the early physicists was [[Ptolemy]] (90–168 CE), one of the leading minds during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, at least three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek, Ἡ Μεγάλη Σύνταξις, \"The Great Treatise\", originally Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις, \"Mathematical Treatise\"). The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman world]].  Much of the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world was lost. Even of the works of the better known thinkers, few fragments survived. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, almost nothing of [[Hipparchus]]' direct work survived. Of the 150 reputed [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] works, only 30 exist, and some of those are \"little more than lecture notes\".  ===India and China=== {{further|History of science and technology in China|History of Indian science and technology}} [[File:Hindu-arabic1.jpg|thumb|The Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

These philosophers believed that other elements (except ether) were physically palpable and hence comprised minuscule particles of matter. The last minuscule particle of matter that could not be subdivided further was termed [[Parmanu]]. These philosophers considered the atom to be indestructible and hence eternal. The Buddhists thought atoms to be minute objects unable to be seen to the naked eye that come into being and vanish in an instant. The [[Vaisheshika]] school of philosophers believed that an atom was a mere point in [[space]]. Indian theories about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation. In [[Indian astronomy]], [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499 CE) proposed the [[Earth's rotation]], while [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544) of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] proposed a semi-heliocentric model resembling the [[Tychonic system]].

Their re-introduction, combined with [[Islam and Judaism|Judeo-Islamic]] theological commentaries, had a great influence on [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. [[Scholasticism|Scholastic European scholars]], who sought to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with [[Christian theology]], proclaimed Aristotle the greatest thinker of the ancient world. In cases where they didn't directly contradict the Bible, Aristotelian physics became the foundation for the physical explanations of the European Churches.  Quantification became a core element of medieval physics.<ref>Alistair C. Crombie, \"Quantification in medieval physics.\" ''Isis'' (1961): 143-160. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/228677 in JSTOR]</ref>    Based on Aristotelian physics, Scholastic physics described things as moving according to their essential nature. Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the [[celestial spheres]]. The [[theory of impetus]], the ancestor to the concepts of [[inertia]] and [[momentum]], was developed along similar lines by [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] such as [[John Philoponus]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Motions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion.  More idealized motion in the \"sublunary\" realm could only be achieved through [[Mechanics (Aristotle)|artifice]], and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world.  Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies.  Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.<ref>David C.

Dissatisfaction with older philosophical approaches had begun earlier and had produced other changes in society, such as the [[Protestant Reformation]], but the revolution in science began when [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] began to mount a sustained attack on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophical program and supposed that mathematical descriptive schemes adopted from such fields as mechanics and astronomy could actually yield universally valid characterizations of motion and other concepts.  ===Nicolaus Copernicus=== {{main|Nicolaus Copernicus|Tycho Brahe|Johannes Kepler}} [[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) is remembered for his development of a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the [[Solar system]].]] A breakthrough in [[astronomy]] was made by Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) when, in 1543, he proposed a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], ostensibly as a means to render tables charting planetary motion more accurate and to simplify their production. In heliocentric models of the Solar system, the Earth orbits the Sun along with other bodies in [[Milky Way|Earth's]] [[galaxy]], a contradiction according to the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century CE; see above), [[Ptolemaic system|whose system]] placed the Earth at the center of the Universe and had been accepted for over 1,400 years. The Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (c.310&nbsp;– c.230 BCE) had suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but Copernicus' theory was the first to be accepted as a valid scientific possibility. Copernicus' book presenting the theory (''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\") was published just before his death in 1543 and, as it is now generally considered to mark the beginning of modern astronomy, is also considered to mark the beginning of the Scientific revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Copernicus' new perspective, along with the accurate observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]], enabled German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|his laws regarding planetary motion]] that remain in use today.  ===Galileo Galilei=== {{main|Galileo Galilei}} [[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Galileo Galilei]]<br/>(1564–1642)]] The Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) was the central figure in the Scientific revolution and famous for his support for Copernicanism, his astronomical discoveries, empirical experiments and his improvement of the telescope. As a mathematician, Galileo's role in the [[History of European research universities|university]] culture of his era was subordinated to the three major topics of study: [[law]], [[medicine]], and [[theology]] (which was closely allied to philosophy).  Galileo, however, felt that the descriptive content of the technical disciplines warranted philosophical interest, particularly because mathematical analysis of astronomical observations&nbsp;– notably, Copernicus' radical analysis of the [[relative motion]]s of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets&nbsp;– indicated that philosophers' statements about the nature of the universe could be shown to be in error.  Galileo also performed mechanical experiments, insisting that motion itself&nbsp;– regardless of whether it was produced \"naturally\" or \"artificially\" (i.e. deliberately)&nbsp;– had universally consistent characteristics that could be described mathematically.  Galileo's early studies at the [[University of Pisa]] were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to mathematics and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, [[Galileo Galilei#Career as a scientist|subsequently, verified]]) the [[:wikt:isochronal|isochronal]] nature of the [[pendulum]] when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Pisa's cathedral]] and found that it remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's [[amplitude]]. He soon became known through his invention of a [[hydrostatic balance]] and for his treatise on the [[Center of mass#Center of gravity|center of gravity]] of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589–92), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their weights. The famous story in which Galileo is said to have [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped weights from]] the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] is apocryphal, but he did find that the [[Ballistic trajectory|path of a projectile]] is a [[parabola]] and is credited with conclusions that anticipated [[Newton's laws of motion]] (e.g. the notion of [[inertia]]). Among these is what is now called [[Galilean relativity]], the first precisely formulated statement about properties of space and time outside [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional geometry]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  [[File:Jupiter and the Galilean Satellites.jpg|thumb|A composite montage comparing [[Jupiter]] (lefthand side) and its four [[Galilean moons]] (top to bottom: [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]).]]  Galileo has been called the \"father of modern [[observational astronomy]]\",<ref>{{citation |title=A Short History of Science to the Nineteenth Century |first=Charles |last=Singer |year=1941 |publisher=Clarendon Press |url=http://www.google.com.au/books?id=mPIgAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1 |postscript=<!--none-->}}, page 217.</ref> the \"father of [[modern physics]]\",<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{citation |last=Weidhorn |first=Manfred |title=The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History |year=2005 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-36877-8 |page=155}}</ref> the \"father of science\",<ref name=\"Einstein\"/> and \"the father of [[modern science]]\".<ref name=\"finocchiaro2007\">[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2007|Finocchiaro (2007)]].</ref> According to [[Stephen Hawking]], \"Galileo, perhaps more than any other single person, was responsible for the birth of modern science.\"<ref>Stephen Hawking, \"Galileo and the Birth of Modern Science\", ''[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology|American Heritage's Invention & Technology]]'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring 2009), p. 36.</ref> As religious orthodoxy decreed a [[Geocentricism|geocentric]] or [[Tychonic system|Tychonic]] understanding of the Solar system, Galileo's support for [[heliocentrism]] provoked controversy and he was tried by the [[Inquisition]].

The contributions that Galileo made to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the [[phases of Venus]]; his discovery, in 1609, of [[Moons of Jupiter|Jupiter's four largest moons]] (subsequently given the collective name of the \"[[Galilean moons]]\"); and the observation and analysis of [[sunspot]]s. Galileo also pursued applied science and technology, inventing, among other instruments, a military [[compass]]. His discovery of the Jovian moons [[Sidereus Nuncius|was published in 1610]] and enabled him to obtain the position of mathematician and philosopher to the [[Medici]] court.  As such, he was expected to engage in debates with philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition and received a large audience for his own publications such as the ''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences]]'' (published abroad following his arrest for the publication of ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'') and ''[[The Assayer]]''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Drake|1978}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Biagioli|1993}}</ref> Galileo's interest in experimenting with and formulating mathematical descriptions of motion established experimentation as an integral part of natural philosophy.  This tradition, combining with the non-mathematical emphasis on the collection of \"experimental histories\" by philosophical reformists such as [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] and [[Francis Bacon]], drew a significant following in the years leading up to and following Galileo's death, including [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and the participants in the [[Accademia del Cimento]] in Italy; [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] in France; [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the Netherlands; and [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]] in England.  ===René Descartes=== {{main|René Descartes}} [[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]<br/>(1596–1650)]] The French philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) was well-connected to, and influential within, the experimental philosophy networks of the day. Descartes had a more ambitious agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition altogether. Questioning the reality interpreted through the senses, Descartes sought to re-establish philosophical explanatory schemes by reducing all perceived phenomena to being attributable to the motion of an invisible sea of \"corpuscles\". (Notably, he reserved human thought and [[God]] from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, such as that of planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were merely different manifestations of an endless chain of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a [[vacuum]] could not exist), and his explanation of [[gravity]] in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shea|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1992}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Gaukroger|2002}}</ref>  Descartes, like Galileo, was convinced of the importance of mathematical explanation, and he and his followers were key figures in the development of mathematics and geometry in the 17th century. Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] and the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, ''[[The Monadology]]''. Descartes has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy', and much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] — allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system — was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], important to the discovery of [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].  ===Isaac Newton=== {{main|Isaac Newton|History of classical mechanics}} [[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]<br/>(1642–1727)]] The late 17th and early 18th centuries saw the achievements of the greatest figure of the Scientific revolution: [[Cambridge University]] physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727), considered by many to be the greatest and most influential scientist who ever lived. Newton, a fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of England]], combined his own discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] and the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies in the heavens. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: [[calculus]] (also invented independently by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.  Newton was able to refute the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles. Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and instead demonstrated that not only regularly observed paths, but all the future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge of their existing motion, their [[mass]], and the [[force]]s acting upon them.  However, observed celestial motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who was also deeply interested in [[theology]], imagined that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.  [[File:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]<br/>(1646–1716)]]  Newton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanation for movement and gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical techniques of [[calculus]], which each had developed independently. Initially, the Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain).  Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical understanding of gravitation, while insisting in his writings that none was necessary to infer its reality.  As the 18th century progressed, Continental natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to forgo [[Ontology|ontological]] metaphysical explanations for mathematically described motions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hall|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Bertolini Meli|1993}}</ref><ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\">{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1999}}</ref>  Newton built the first functioning [[reflecting telescope]]<ref name=\"The Early Period (1608–1672)\">{{vcite web |url=http://etoile.berkeley.edu/~jrg/TelescopeHistory/Early_Period.html |title=The Early Period (1608–1672) |accessdate=3 February 2009 |publisher=James R.

While Newton explained light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support until the 19th century. Newton also formulated [[Newton's law of cooling|an empirical law of cooling]], studied the [[speed of sound]], investigated [[power series]], demonstrated the [[Binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]] and developed [[Newton's method|a method]] for approximating the [[Root of a function|roots of a function]]. His work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.<ref>{{citation |last1=Błaszczyk |first1=Piotr |author1-link= |last2=Katz |first2=Mikhail |author2-link=Mikhail Katz |last3=Sherry |first3=David |author3-link= |arxiv=1202.4153 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 |issue= |journal=[[Foundations of Science]] |pages= |title=Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking |volume= |year=2012}}</ref> Most importantly, Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth during the Scientific revolution, Newton effectively established the foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.  ===Other achievements=== Other branches of physics also received attention during the period of the Scientific revolution. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Wilbert Gilbert]], court physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the [[Boyle's law|gas law named for him]]; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the [[Royal Society of England]] (1660) and the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences in France]] (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as [[John Wallis]], [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]], [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[John Mayow]], and [[Christopher Wren]] (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, [[James Bernoulli]] showed that the [[cycloid]] is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, [[Johann Bernoulli]] showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a [[catenary]], the curve with the lowest possible [[center of gravity]] available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the [[brachistochrone]] problem.  ====Early thermodynamics==== A precursor of the engine was designed by the German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and created the world's first ever [[vacuum]] known as the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment.  He was driven to make a vacuum to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that [[Horror vacui (physics)|'Nature abhors a vacuum']]. Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: ''PV'' = ''k'', where ''P'' is [[pressure]], ''V'' is [[volume]] and ''k'' is a constant: this relationship is known as [[Boyle's Law]]. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive [[Gay-Lussac's law|his law]], which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.  Later designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[Watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.  {{clear left}}  == 18th-century developments ==  During the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later termed [[classical mechanics]]).  ===Mechanics=== [[File:Danielbernoulli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]<br/>(1700–1782)]] In 1714, [[Brook Taylor]] derived the [[fundamental frequency]] of a stretched vibrating string in terms of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a [[differential equation]]. The Swiss mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700–1782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Darrigol|2005}}</ref> In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the fundamental frequency and [[harmonic]]s of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of [[fluid dynamics]] and his examination of [[fluid]] flow was introduced in his 1738 work ''Hydrodynamica''.  Rational mechanics dealt primarily with the development of elaborate mathematical treatments of observed motions, using Newtonian principles as a basis, and emphasized improving the tractability of complex calculations and developing of legitimate means of analytical approximation. A representative contemporary textbook was published by [[Johann Baptiste Horvath]]. By the end of the century analytical treatments were rigorous enough to verify the stability of the [[solar system]] solely on the basis of Newton's laws without reference to divine intervention—even as deterministic treatments of systems as simple as the [[n-body problem|three body problem]] in gravitation remained intractable.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bos|1980}}</ref> In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] predicted the periodicity of [[Halley's Comet]], [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, and [[Henry Cavendish]] measured the [[gravitational constant]] and determined the mass of the Earth in 1798. In 1783, [[John Michell]] suggested that some objects might be so massive that not even light could escape from them.  In 1739, [[Leonhard Euler]] solved the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, [[Colin Maclaurin]] discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]. In 1743, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published his \"Traite de Dynamique\", in which he introduces the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints. In 1747, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the Bessel function solutions. In 1776, [[John Smeaton]] published a paper on experiments relating power, [[work (physics)|work]], [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]], and supporting the [[conservation of energy]]. In 1788, Joseph Louis Lagrange presented [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations of motion]] in ''Mécanique Analytique''. In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] states the law of [[conservation of mass]]. Newton's mechanics received brilliant exposition in both Lagrange's 1788 work and the ''Celestial Mechanics'' (1799–1825) of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].  ===Thermodynamics=== During the 18th century, thermodynamics was developed through the theories of weightless [[imponderable fluid|\"imponderable fluids\"]], such as heat (\"caloric\"), [[history of electricity|electricity]], and [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]] (which was rapidly overthrown as a concept following [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] identification of [[oxygen]] gas late in the century).  Assuming that these concepts were real fluids, their flow could be traced through a mechanical apparatus or chemical reactions.  This tradition of experimentation led to the development of new kinds of experimental apparatus, such as the [[Leyden Jar]]; and new kinds of measuring instruments, such as the [[calorimeter]], and improved versions of old ones, such as the [[thermometer]].  Experiments also produced new concepts, such as the [[University of Glasgow]] experimenter [[Joseph Black]]'s notion of [[latent heat]] and Philadelphia intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s characterization of electrical fluid as flowing between places of excess and deficit (a concept later reinterpreted in terms of positive and negative [[electric charge|charges]]). Franklin also showed that lightning is electricity in 1752.  The accepted theory of heat in the 18th century viewed it as a kind of fluid, called [[caloric theory|caloric]]; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including [[Joseph Black]] (1728–99) and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731–1810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.  While it was recognized early in the 18th century that finding absolute theories of electrostatic and magnetic force akin to Newton's principles of motion would be an important achievement, none were forthcoming.  This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined in the early years of the 19th century in places such as the newly established [[Royal Institution]] in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]]'s analytical treatment of the flow of heat, as published in 1822.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heilbron|1979}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Golinski|1999}}</ref> [[Joseph Priestley]] proposed an electrical inverse-square law in 1767, and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] introduced the inverse-square law of [[electrostatics]] in 1798.  At the end of the century, the members of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] had attained clear dominance in the field.<ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\" /><ref>{{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1999}}</ref> At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted.  The [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, [[magnetism]], [[static electricity]], [[history of chemistry|chemistry]], and [[physiology]] were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, experiment design were emerging.  Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ben-Chaim|2004}}</ref>  {{clear left}}  == 19th century == [[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]]<br/>(1791–1867)]]  In 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the electric battery (known of the [[voltaic pile]]) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrated the wave nature of light—which received strong experimental support from the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]—and the principle of interference. In 1813, [[Peter Ewart]] supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper ''On the measure of moving force''. In 1820, [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after Ørsted's discovery reached France, [[André-Marie Ampère]] discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, [[Michael Faraday]] built an electricity-powered motor, while [[Georg Ohm]] stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] discovered [[Brownian motion]]: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid.  In 1829, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] introduced the terms of [[Work (physics)|work]] (force times distance) and [[kinetic energy]] with the meanings they have today.  In 1831, Faraday (and independently [[Joseph Henry]]) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism&nbsp;– known as [[Faraday's law of induction|electromagnetic induction]]; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating [[ellipsoid]]s. In 1834, [[John Scott Russell|John Russell]] observed a nondecaying solitary water wave ([[soliton]]) in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] near [[Edinburgh]] and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's canonical equations of motion]]. In the same year, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the [[Coriolis effect]]. In 1841, [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], an [[amateur]] scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, [[Christian Doppler]] proposed the [[Doppler effect]]. In 1847, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, [[Léon Foucault]] showed the Earth's rotation with a huge [[pendulum]] ([[Foucault pendulum]]).  There were important advances in [[continuum mechanics]] in the first half of the century, namely formulation of [[elastic modulus|laws of elasticity]] for solids and discovery of [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for fluids.  ===Laws of thermodynamics=== {{further|History of thermodynamics}} [[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|right|{{nowrap|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]<br/>(1824–1907)}}]] In the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] and [[James Prescott Joule]], who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]—a restatement of the [[law of conservation of energy]]—which was stated around 1850 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later known as Lord Kelvin, and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of [[Lazare Carnot]], Sadi Carnot, and [[Émile Clapeyron]]–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.  Kelvin and Clausius also stated the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]'s influential work ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy'') and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Léon Foucault]] measured the [[speed of light]] in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the [[Joule–Thomson effect]] or Joule–Kelvin effect. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] puts forward the idea of the [[heat death of the universe]] in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of ''dQ/T'' ([[Clausius's theorem]]) (though he did not yet name the quantity).  ===James Clerk Maxwell=== [[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|180px|left|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]<br/>(1831–1879)]] In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|distribution law of molecular velocities]]. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]]. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.  The prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a \"[[Luminiferous aether|luminiferous ether]]\", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s 1888 detection of [[electromagnetic radiation]], was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Jungnickel and McCormmanch|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hunt|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1994}}</ref> Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the [[photoelectric effect]]. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed a [[radio wave]] based [[wireless telegraphy]] system<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hX1jPbJVSu4C&pg=PA193&dq=invention+of+radio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UmpZUsObFa_K4APjp4DgDQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=invention%20of%20radio&f=false Michael Windelspecht, Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 19th Century, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 page 195]</ref> (see [[invention of radio]]).  The atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist [[John Dalton]] and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The kinetic theory in turn led to the statistical mechanics of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] (1844–1906) and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] (1839–1903), which held that energy (including heat) was a measure of the speed of particles.  Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"[[entropy]]\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"[[Maxwell's demon]]\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|Wise|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1998}}</ref> In 1902, [[James Jeans]] found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.  {{clear left}}  == 20th century: birth of modern physics == <!-- [[Template:Modern physics]] links here --> [[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]]<br/>(1867–1934)]]  At the end of the 19th century, physics had evolved to the point at which [[classical mechanics]] could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories—the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear—and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in [[blackbody radiation]] and the [[photoelectric effect]], while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Emil Cohn]], [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of [[classical physics]] were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as [[modern physics]].<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Agar|2012\">{{Harvtxt|Agar|2012}}</ref>  ===Radiation experiments=== [[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|200px|[[J. J. Thomson]] (1856–1940) discovered the [[electron]] and [[Isotope|isotopy]] and also invented the [[mass spectrometer]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1906.]] In the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] caused a sensation with his discovery of [[X-ray]]s in 1895; in 1896 [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], and new radioactive elements found by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"[[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements [[radium]] and [[polonium]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element [[helium]]. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]]—known as the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]—which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical luminiferous ether, for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called [[Nuclear power|\"atomic\" energy]].  ===Albert Einstein's theory of relativity=== In 1905 a young, 26-year-old German physicist (then a Bern patent clerk) named [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955), showed how measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. To say that Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science is no exaggeration. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the theory of relativity alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is constant, i.e. the same for all observers,  and an absolute physical boundary for motion. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects traveling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, which expresses the [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].  ====Special relativity==== {{further|History of special relativity}} [[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|250px|<!--Refining/rephrasing?:-->[[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) proposed that [[gravitation]] was a result of [[mass]]es (or their [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalent energies]]) [[Curvature of spacetime|curving (\"bending\")]] the [[spacetime]] in which they exist, altering the paths they follow within it.]]  Einstein argued that the speed of light was a constant in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frames]] and that electromagnetic laws should remain valid independent of reference frame—assertions which rendered the ether \"superfluous\" to physical theory, and that held that observations of time and length varied relative to how the observer was moving with respect to the object being measured (what came to be called the \"[[special relativity|special theory of relativity]]\").  It also followed that mass and energy were interchangeable quantities according to the equation [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>]].  In another paper published the same year, Einstein asserted that electromagnetic radiation was transmitted in discrete quantities (\"[[Quantum|quanta]]\"), according to a constant that the theoretical physicist [[Max Planck]] had posited in 1900 to arrive at an accurate theory for the distribution of [[blackbody radiation]]—an assumption that explained the strange properties of the [[photoelectric effect]].  The special theory of relativity is a formulation of the relationship between physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying \"ether\" and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson–Morley experiment. Einstein demolished these questions and the ether concept in his special theory of relativity. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: \"What is time?\" Newton, in the ''Principia'' (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: \"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration.\" This definition is basic to all classical physics.  Einstein had the genius to question it, and found that it was incomplete. Instead, each \"observer\" necessarily makes use of his or her own scale of time, and for two observers in relative motion, their time-scales will differ. This induces a related effect on position measurements. Space and time become intertwined concepts, fundamentally dependent on the observer. Each observer presides over his or her own space-time framework or coordinate system. There being no absolute frame of reference, all observers of given events make different but equally valid (and reconcilable) measurements.  What remains absolute is stated in Einstein's relativity postulate: \"The basic laws of physics are identical for two observers who have a constant relative velocity with respect to each other.\"  Special Relativity had a profound effect on physics: started as a rethinking of the theory of electromagnetism, it found a new [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry law]] of nature, now called ''[[Poincaré symmetry]]'', that replaced the old Galilean (see [[#Galileo Galilei|above]]) symmetry.  Special Relativity exerted another long-lasting effect on [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]]. Although initially it was credited with the \"unification of mass and energy\", it became evident that [[relativistic dynamics]] established a firm ''distinction'' between [[rest mass]], which is an invariant (observer independent) property of a [[particle]] or system of particles, and the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of a system.  The latter two are separately [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] in all situations but not invariant with respect to different observers. The term ''[[mass]]'' in [[particle physics]] underwent a [[semantic change]], and since the late 20th century it almost exclusively denotes the [[invariant mass|rest (or ''invariant'') mass]]. See [[mass in special relativity]] for additional discussion.  ====General relativity====  {{further|History of general relativity}} By 1916, Einstein was able to generalize this further, to deal with all states of motion including non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] — a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.  The gradual acceptance of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of Niels Bohr's model of the atom created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles.  Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the \"[[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]\") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading to the conclusion that space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as [[gravitational lens]]ing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields. m  ===Quantum mechanics=== {{further|History of quantum mechanics}} [[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|180px|right|[[Max Planck]]<br/>(1858–1947)]] Although relativity resolved the electromagnetic phenomena conflict demonstrated by Michelson and Morley, a second theoretical problem was the explanation of the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]]; experiment showed that at shorter wavelengths, toward the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, the energy approached zero, but classical theory predicted it should become infinite. This glaring discrepancy, known as the ultraviolet catastrophe, was solved by the new theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics is the theory of [[atom]]s and subatomic systems. Approximately the first 30 years of the 20th century represent the time of the conception and evolution of the theory. The basic ideas of quantum theory were introduced in 1900 by [[Max Planck]] (1858–1947), who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1918 for his discovery of the quantified nature of energy. The quantum theory (which previously relied in the \"correspondence\" at large scales between the quantized world of the atom and the continuities of the \"[[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical]]\" world) was accepted when the [[Compton Effect]] established that light carries momentum and can scatter off particles, and when [[Louis de Broglie]] asserted that matter can be seen as behaving as a wave in much the same way as electromagnetic waves behave like particles ([[wave–particle duality]]).  [[File:Heisenberg 10.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Werner Heisenberg]]<br/>(1901–1976)]]  In 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] used the same constant to explain the stability of [[Rutherford model|Rutherford's atom]] as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in [[Matrix mechanics|matrix-form]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of [[causality]]. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"[[uncertainty principle]]\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and [[momentum]]) and the \"[[Copenhagen interpretation]]\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\".<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\">{{Harvtxt|Kragh|1999}}</ref> The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]]'s work on [[photon]]s and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], the theory of the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].  {{anchor|spin–statistics}} The [[spin–statistics theorem]] established that any particle in quantum mechanics may be either a [[boson]] (statistically Bose–Einstein) or a [[fermion]] (statistically [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac]]). It was later found that all [[Elementary particle|fundamental]] bosons transmit forces, such as the photon that transmits light.{{clarify|post-text=(Is light a \"force\"?)|date=February 2015}}  Fermions are particles \"like electrons and nucleons\" and are the usual constituents of [[matter]]. Fermi–Dirac statistics later found numerous other uses, from astrophysics (see [[Degenerate matter]]) to [[semiconductor]] design.  {{clear left}}  == Contemporary and particle physics == {{further|History of subatomic physics}}  ===Quantum field theory=== [[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|right|A [[Feynman diagram]] representing (left to right) the production of a photon (blue [[sine wave]]) from the [[annihilation]] of an electron and its complementary [[antiparticle]], the [[positron]]. The photon becomes a [[quark]]–[[antiquark]] pair and a [[gluon]] (green spiral) is released.]]  As the philosophically inclined continued to debate the fundamental nature of the universe, quantum theories continued to be produced, beginning with [[Paul Dirac]]'s formulation of a relativistic quantum theory in 1928.  However, attempts to quantize electromagnetic theory entirely were stymied throughout the 1930s by theoretical formulations yielding infinite energies. This situation was not considered adequately resolved until after [[World War&nbsp;II]] ended, when [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] independently posited the technique of [[renormalization]], which allowed for an establishment of a robust [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schweber|1994}}</ref>  Meanwhile, new theories of [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]] proliferated with the rise of the idea of the [[Quantum field theory|quantization of fields]] through \"[[Exchange interaction|exchange forces]]\" regulated by an exchange of short-lived [[Virtual particle|\"virtual\" particle]]s, which were allowed to exist according to the laws governing the uncertainties inherent in the quantum world. Notably, [[Hideki Yukawa]] proposed that the positive charges of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were kept together courtesy of a powerful but short-range force mediated by a particle with a mass between that of the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. This particle, the \"[[pion]]\", was identified in 1947 as part of what became a slew of particles discovered after World War II. Initially, such particles were found as [[Ionization|ionizing radiation]] left by [[cosmic ray]]s, but increasingly came to be produced in newer and more powerful [[particle accelerator]]s.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Galison|1997}}</ref>  Outside particle physics, significant advances of the time were: * the invention of the [[laser]] (1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]); * the theoretical and experimental research of [[superconductivity]], especially the invention of a [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|quantum theory of superconductivity]] by [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and [[Lev Landau]] (2002 Nobel Prize in Physics) and, later, its explanation via [[Cooper pair]]s (1972 Nobel Prize in Physics). The Cooper pair was an early example of [[quasiparticle]]s.  ===Unified field theories=== {{main|Unified field theory}} Einstein deemed that all [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to \"merge\" several interactions. One of formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a ''[[gauge theory]]'', a generalization of the idea of symmetry. Eventually the [[Standard Model]] (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify [[gravitation]] with something else failed. {{expand section|date=January 2014}}  ===Standard Model=== {{main|Standard Model}} [[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Standard Model]].]] The interaction of these particles by [[scattering]] and [[Particle decay|decay]] provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Yuval Ne'eman]] brought some order to these new particles by classifying them according to certain qualities, beginning with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \"[[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]\". While its further development, the [[quark model]], at first seemed inadequate to describe [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]], allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the [[S-Matrix]], the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]] in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"[[Standard Model|standard model]]\" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for [[gravitation]], and which remains generally accepted within its domain of application.<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\"/>  The Standard Model groups the [[electroweak interaction]] theory and [[quantum chromodynamics]] into a structure denoted by the [[gauge group]] SU(3)&times;SU(2)&times;U(1). The formulation of the unification of the electromagnetic and [[weak interaction]]s in the standard model is due to [[Abdus Salam]], [[Steven Weinberg]] and, subsequently, [[Sheldon Glashow]].

However, starting in the 1990s, astronomical observations have also provided new challenges, such as the need for new explanations of galactic stability (\"[[dark matter]]\") and the [[Accelerating universe|apparent acceleration in the expansion of the universe]] (\"[[dark energy]]\").  While accelerators have confirmed most aspects of the Standard Model by detecting expected particle interactions at various collision energies, no theory reconciling general relativity with the Standard Model has yet been found, although [[supersymmetry]] and [[string theory]] were believed by many theorists to be a promising avenue forward. The [[Large Hadron Collider]], however, which began operating in 2008, has failed to find any evidence whatsoever that is supportive of supersymmetry and string theory.<ref>{{cite web |last=Woit |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Woit |date=20 October 2013 |title=Last Links For a While |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6362 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |work=Not Even Wrong}}</ref>  ===Cosmology=== {{main|Physical cosmology}} Cosmology may be said to have become a serious research question with the publication of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1916 [1915?] although it did not enter the scientific mainstream until the period known as the \"[[Golden age of general relativity]]\".  About a decade later, in the midst of what was dubbed the \"[[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]]\", Hubble and Slipher discovered the expansion of universe in the 1920s measuring the redshifts of Doppler spectra from galactic nebulae. Using Einstein's general relativity, Lemaître and Gamow formulated what would become known as the big bang theory. A rival, called the steady state theory was devised by Hoyle, Gold, Narlikar and Bondi.  Cosmic background radiation was verified in the 1960s by Penzias and Wilson, and this discovery favoured the big bang at the expense of the steady state scenario. Later work was by Smoot et al. (1989), among other contributors, using data from the Cosmic Background explorer (CoBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP) satellites that refined these observations. The 1980s (the same decade of the COBE measurements) also saw the proposal of inflation theory by Guth.  Recently the problems of dark matter and dark energy have risen to the top of the cosmology agenda.  ===Higgs boson=== [[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|250px|One possible signature of a Higgs boson from a simulated [[proton]]–proton collision. It decays almost immediately into two jets of [[hadron]]s and two [[electron]]s, visible as lines.]] On July 4, 2012, physicists working at CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]] announced that they had discovered a new subatomic particle greatly resembling the [[Higgs boson]], a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&ref=science |work=The New York Times |first=Dennis |last=Overbye |title=Physicists Find Particle That Could Be the Higgs Boson |date=4 July 2012}}</ref> For now, some physicists are calling it a \"Higgslike\" particle.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> [[Joe Incandela]], of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], said, \"It's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of [[quark]]s, for example.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]], a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said:  {{quote |\"''This is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads — will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?''\"|author=[[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]], University of Chicago<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>}}  [[Peter Higgs]] was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who, in 1964, invented the notion of the Higgs field (\"cosmic molasses\"). The others were [[Tom Kibble]] of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College, London]]; [[C. R. Hagen|Carl Hagen]] of the [[University of Rochester]]; [[Gerald Guralnik]] of [[Brown University]]; and [[François Englert]] and [[Robert Brout]], both of [[Université libre de Bruxelles]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>  Although they have never been seen, Higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>  {{clear left}}  == Physical sciences ==  With increased accessibility to and elaboration upon advanced analytical techniques in the 19th century, physics was defined as much, if not more, by those techniques than by the search for universal principles of motion and energy, and the fundamental nature of [[matter]].  Fields such as [[acoustics]], [[geophysics]], [[astrophysics]], [[aerodynamics]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]], [[Cryogenics|low-temperature physics]], and [[solid-state physics]] joined [[optics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[mechanics]] as areas of physical research.  In the 20th century, physics also became closely allied with such fields as [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]] and [[Materials science|materials]] engineering, and physicists began to work in government and industrial laboratories as much as in academic settings. Following World War&nbsp;II, the population of physicists increased dramatically, and came to be centered on the United States, while, in more recent decades, physics has become a more international pursuit than at any time in its previous history.  == Seminal physics publications ==  {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:left\"| Author !style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:left\"| Dates !colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:left\"| Contribution |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Aristotle]] |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 384 – 322 [[BCE]] |colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[Physicae Auscultationes]]'' |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Archimedes]] |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 287 – 212 BCE |colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Ptolemy]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|      90 – 168 |colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| {{hlist|''[[Almagest]]''|''[[Geographia]]''|''[[Apotelesmatika]]''}} |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Alhazen]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|    965 – 1040 |colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[Book of Optics]]'' |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1473 – 1543 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres]]'' |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1543 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Galileo Galilei|Galilei]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1564 – 1642 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1632 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[René Descartes|Descartes]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1596 – 1650 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1641 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1643 – 1727 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1687 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1791 – 1867 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14986 ''Experimental Researches in Electricity''] {{small|([[Project Gutenberg]])}} |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1839&nbsp;/ 1844 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1831 – 1879 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1873 |- |style=\"padding-left:0.5em;padding-right:0.5em\"| [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"|   1879 – 1955 |style=\"padding-left:0.5em\"| [[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]] |style=\"text-align:right;padding-right:0.5em\"| 1905 |}  == Influential physicists == {{famous|date=January 2014}}  The following is a gallery of highly influential and important figures in the history of physics.

They are similar in appearance and purpose to [[aerofoil]]s used by [[aeroplane]]s. [[Boat]]s using hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. As speed is gained, hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and thus allowing greater speeds.  ==Description== The hydrofoil usually consists of a [[Wing]]-like structure mounted on [[strut]]s below the [[hull (ship)|hull]], or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats (see illustration). As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull(s) develop enough [[lift (force)|lift]] to raise the hull out of the water in order to greatly reduce hull [[drag (physics)|drag]]. This gives a further corresponding increase in [[speed]] and efficiency of operation in terms of fuel consumption.  A wider adoption of the technical innovations of hydrofoils is prevented by the increased complexity of building and maintaining them. Hydrofoils are generally prohibitively more expensive than conventional watercraft. However, the design is simple enough that there are many [[human-powered hydrofoil]] designs. Amateur experimentation and development of the concept is popular.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hydrofoil+design&search=Search&gl=CA&hl=en</ref>  ==Hydrodynamic mechanics== [[File:Hydrofoil types.svg|450px|thumb|The two types of hydrofoils: surface-piercing and fully submerged]]  Since air and water are governed by similar [[fluid dynamics|fluid equations]], albeit with vastly different levels of [[viscosity]], [[density]], and [[compressible flow|compressibility]], the hydrofoil and [[airfoil]] (both types of [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]]) create [[lift (force)|lift]] in identical ways.  The foil is shaped to move smoothly through the water causing the flow to be deflected downward which according to Newton's Third Law of Motion exerts an upward force on the foil.  This turning of the water causes higher pressure on the bottom and reduced pressure on the top of the foil. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via [[Bernoulli's principle]], so the resulting flowfield about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.  When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed. The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft, reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water, but remains in equilibrium. Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of [[drag (physics)]] on the hull are eliminated as the hull is lifted clear, turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil, and decreasingly on the hull, creating a marked increase in speed.  ===Foil configurations=== Early hydrofoils used V-shaped foils. Hydrofoils of this type are known as \"surface-piercing\" since portions of the V-shape hydrofoils will rise above the water surface when foilborne. Some modern hydrofoils use inverted T-shape foils which are fully submerged. Fully submerged hydrofoils are less subject to the effects of wave action, and are therefore more stable at sea and are more comfortable for the crew and passengers. This type of configuration, however, is not self-stabilizing. The [[angle of attack]] on the hydrofoils needs to be adjusted continuously in accordance to the changing conditions, a control process that is performed by sensors, a computer and active surfaces.  == History == [[File:Forlanini Idroplano-Forlani Hydrofoil 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Enrico Forlanini|Forlanini's]] hydrofoil over [[Lake Maggiore]], 1910.]]  === Prototypes ===  Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] began working on hydrofoils in 1898 and used a \"ladder\" foils system.

Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement, and after reading the article began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. With his chief engineer [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Casey Baldwin]], Bell began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models based on his designs, which led them to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. During Bell's world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Bell's large laboratory at his [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in Bell's ''[[HD-4]]''. Using [[Renault]] engines, a top speed of 87&nbsp;km/h (54&nbsp;mph) was achieved, accelerating rapidly, taking waves without difficulty, steering well and showing good stability. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy]] permitted him to obtain two 260&nbsp;kW (350 horsepower) engines. On 9 September 1919 the ''HD-4'' set a world marine speed record of 114&nbsp;km/h (70.86&nbsp;mph), a record which stood for two decades. A full-scale replica of the ''HD-4'' is viewable at the [[Alexander Graham Bell#Legacy and honors|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]] museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.  In the early 1950s an English couple built the ''White Hawk'', a jet-powered hydrofoil water craft, in an attempt to beat the absolute water speed record.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8NsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S8Q4T9XAH8aygwe0k-nnBQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Jet Hydrofoil Shoots At World Record\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1953, pp. 70-71</ref> However, in tests, ''White Hawk'' could barely top the record breaking speed of the 1919 ''HD-4''.  The designers had faced an engineering phenomenon that limits the top speed of even modern hydrofoils: [[cavitation]] disturbs the lift created by the foils as they move through the water at speed above 70&nbsp;mph, bending the lifting foil.<ref>''The World Water Speed Record'' by Leo Villa and Kevin Desmond, 1976</ref>  [[File:Fully submerged hydrofoils self-stabilizing system.svg|thumb|A schematic illustration of self-stabilizing systems for fully submerged hydrofoils. Its computer gathers data for the boom position and current water level to determine the required flap position.]]  === First passenger boats ===  German engineer [[Hanns von Schertel]] worked on hydrofoils prior to and during [[World War II]] in [[Germany]]. After the war Schertel's team was captured by the Russians. As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats, Schertel himself went to [[Switzerland]], where he established the Supramar company. In 1952, Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil, PT10 \"Freccia d'Oro\" (Golden Arrow), in Lake Maggiore, between Switzerland and [[Italy]]. The PT10 is of surface-piercing type, it can carry 32 passengers and travel at {{convert|35|kn|km/h}}. In 1968, [[Hussain Najadi]] the Bahraini born banker, acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Norway and the US. [[General Dynamics]] of the United States became its licensee, and the Pentagon awarded its first R&D naval research project in the field of [[supercavitation]]. [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Shipbuilding of Osaka, Japan, was another licensee of Supramar, as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries.  From 1952 to 1971, Supramar designed many models of hydrofoils: PT20, PT50, PT75, PT100 and PT150. All are of surface-piercing type, except the PT150 combining a surface-piercing foil forward with a fully submerged foil in the aft location. Over 200 of Supramar's design were built, most of them by Rodriquez in Italy.  During the same period the [[Soviet Union]] experimented extensively with hydrofoils, constructing hydrofoil river boats and [[ferries]] with streamlined designs during the cold war period and into the 1980s. Such vessels include the [[Raketa (hydrofoil)|Raketa]] (1957) type, followed by the larger [[Meteor (hydrofoil)|Meteor]] type and the smaller [[Voskhod (hydrofoil)|Voskhod]] type. One of the most successful Soviet designer/inventor in this area was [[Rostislav Alexeyev]] who some consider the 'father' of the modern hydrofoil due to his 1950's era high speed hydrofoil designs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Later, circa 1970's, Alexeyev combined his hydrofoil experience with the [[Ground effect in aircraft|surface effect]] principle to create the [[Ekranoplan]].  In 1961, [[SRI International]] issued a study on \"The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in U.S. Domestic and Foreign Commerce\".<ref>{{cite web | title=The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in U.S. Domestic and Foreign Commerce. | author=[[SRI International]] | url=http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/00026416.html | year=1961 | accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref> Commercial use of hydrofoils in the U.S. first appeared in 1961 when two commuter vessels were commissioned by [[Harry Gale Nye, Jr.]]'s North American Hydrofoils to service the route from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey to the financial district of Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web | title=Enterprise| author=[http://www.foils.org/ foils.org]| url=http://www.foils.org/gallery/enterpr.htm | accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>  ==Military usage== [[File:BTK pr.206M2.jpg|thumb|A Project 206M \"Shtorm\" (NATO - Turya class) patrol fast attack craft hydrofoil of the [[Cuban Navy]].]] [[File:Sparviero DN-ST-84-03940.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aerial port beam view of the Italian Sparviero class hydrofoil-missile NIBBIO P-421 underway.]] [[File:PHM-4.jpg|thumb|[[USS Aquila (PHM-4)|USS ''Aquila'']], a military hydrofoil. The T-shaped foils are visible just below the water.]] [[File:HMCS Bras d'Or 03.jpg|thumb|HMCS Bras d'Or, a military concept hydrofoil.]]  In Canada during World War II, Baldwin worked on an experimental [[smoke screen|smoke laying]] hydrofoil (later called the Comox Torpedo) that was later superseded by other smoke-laying technology and an experimental target-towing hydrofoil. The forward two foil assemblies of what is believed to be the latter hydrofoil were salvaged in the mid-1960s from a derelict hulk in Baddeck, Nova Scotia by Colin MacGregor Stevens. These were donated to the Maritime Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Armed Forces]] built and tested a number of hydrofoils (e.g. Baddeck and two vessels named Bras d'Or), which culminated in the high-speed anti-submarine hydrofoil [[HMCS Bras d'Or (FHE 400)|HMCS Bras d'Or]] in the late 1960s. However, the program was cancelled in the early 1970s due to a shift away from [[anti-submarine warfare]] by the Canadian military.  The Bras d'Or was a surface-piercing type that performed well during her trials, reaching a maximum speed of {{convert|63|kn|km/h}}.  The USSR introduced several hydrofoil-based fast attack craft into [[Soviet Navy|their navy]], principally: * the [[Sarancha class missile boat]], a unique vessel built in the 1970s * the [[Turya class torpedo boat]], which was introduced in 1972 and still remains in service today * the [[Matka class missile boat]], which was introduced in the 1980s and still remains in service today * the [[Muravey class patrol boat]], which was introduced in the 1980s and still remains in service today  The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] began experiments with hydrofoils in the mid-1950s by funding a sailing vessel that used hydrofoils to reach speeds in the 30&nbsp;mph range.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=u-EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA136&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uoxET6-bFcPVgQf2s_i2BA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Sail Boat Stilts Boost Speed.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1956, p. 136.</ref> The ''XCH-4'' (officially, ''Experimental Craft, Hydrofoil No. 4''), designed by [[William P.

Three similar boats were built for the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].  ==Sailing and sports== {{main|Sailing hydrofoil}} The French experimental [[sail]] powered hydrofoil ''[[Hydroptère]]'' is the result of a research project that involves advanced engineering skills and technologies.

It was stopped due to a new [[speed limit]]. * Between 1981 and 1990, \"[[Transmediterranea]]\" used to operate a service of hydrofoils connecting [[Ceuta]] and [[Algeciras]] in the Strait of Gibraltar. The crossing took half an hour, in comparison to the hour an a half of conventional ferries. Due to the common extreme winds and storms that take place in winter in the Strait of Gibraltar, the service was substituted in 1990 by catamarans, which were also able to carry cars. At the peak of the year, in summer, there was a service every half an hour in each direction. This high-speed connection had a big impact on the development of Ceuta, facilitating one-day business trips to mainland Spain. See also the history of [[Condor Ferries]] which operated 6 hydrofoil ferries over a 29-year period between the [[Channel Islands]], south coast of [[England]] and [[Saint-Malo]].  == Disadvantages == {{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}} Hydrofoils had their peak in popularity in the 1960s and 70s.  Since then there has been a steady decline in their use and popularity for leisure, military and commercial passenger transport use.  There are a number of reasons for this:  * Hydrofoils are sensitive to impacts with floating objects and marine animals. On hitting something, a hydrofoil boat may fall off the foils, which often creates a perception of increased danger. However, hydrofoils operating in Hong Kong, reportedly some of the most littered waters, operate relatively trouble free. The Hong Kong Marine department maintains online records of all accidents in its waters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  * Hydrofoils have sharp edges that reside in the water while in operation.  These edges can fatally injure marine mammals (e.g. whales) they hit.  *  Hydrofoils are expensive to build. A vessel like the Boeing Jetfoil currently costs about 3 times the price of an equivalent catamaran passenger ferry. The increased costs are not always economically justifiable by consumers.  Simpler designs such as those of Russian design and those by Rodriquez in Italy are more competitive in price and are still being produced today for operation on ferry routes.  * It is a very conservative industry. Hydrofoils are still considered exotic by many commercial operators of high-speed craft and many will not take the risk of trying such exotic vessels when they have no experience in operating them. Those that do have found benefit in their operation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  * They are technically complex and require high maintenance, which has put an end to most military hydrofoil projects. The US Navy for example developed some of the most technically advanced hydrofoils around but they could never get them to be reliable due to the complex propulsion systems and ride control required.  This eventually led to the suspension of their hydrofoil projects.  Most other Navy developments followed the same fate.  The Russian Navy still operates very large hydrofoils and have been successful in their design, largely because they have opted for simpler systems that might not have the same performance as the US designs but are much more robust and reliable.  In Hong Kong, the increasing maintenance cost of keeping the old Jetfoils running is resulting in these vessels slowly being phased out.  == See also == {{col-begin}}{{col-break}} * [[Boeing hydrofoils]] * [[Disco Volante (ship)]] * [[Flyak]] &ndash; a hydrofoil kayak * [[Foilboard]] * ''[[The Hydrofoil Mystery]]'' &ndash; historical fiction * [[Planing (sailing)]] * [[Raketa (hydrofoil)]] {{col-break|gap=4em}} * [[Riverboat]] * [[Sailing hydrofoil]] * [[Sit-down hydrofoil]] * [[Supercavitation]] * [[Trampofoil]] &ndash; a one-person human-powered hydrofoil * [[Voskhod (hydrofoil)]] {{col-end}}  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{wiktionary|hydrofoil}} {{commons category|Hydrofoils}} * [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/hydrofoil-limits.htm Limitations of hydrofoils] * [http://foils.org The International Hydrofoil Society] * [http://www.hysucraft.com Fast CC Hydrofoil design by Prof. KG Hoppe, inventor of HYSUCAT technology patented by University of Stellenbosch, S.A.] * [http://www.hawctech.com Hydrofoil Assisted Water Craft employing HYSUCAT and HYSUWAC patents in their projects and vessels currently in operation] * [http://www.hysucat.co.za Hysucat Design, South African originators of Hydrofoil Supported Catamaran technology] * [http://www.hydrofoils.ch Swiss experimental hydrofoils] * [http://www.hyraii.ethz.ch HyRaii - Hydrofoil Sailboat, Student Project ETH Zurich]  {{Public transport|state=collapsed}}  {{Authority control}}  [[Category:Hydrofoils|*]] [[Category:Nautical terms]] [[Category:English inventions]]</td></tr><tr><td>Henri Chopin</td><td>13763</td><td>679361892</td><td>2015-09-04T02:58:58.000+0000</td><td>Ser Amantio di Nicolao</td><td>753665</td><td>{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}} {{Refimprove|date=January 2011}} {{See also|Chopin (disambiguation)}} '''Henri Chopin''' (18 June 1922 – 3 January 2008) was an avant-garde poet and musician.  ==Life== Henri Chopin was born in Paris,18 June 1922, one of three brothers, and the son of an accountant. Both his siblings died during the war. One was shot by a German soldier the day after an armistice was declared in Paris, the other while sabotaging a train (Acquaviva 2008).  Chopin was a French practitioner of [[concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[sound poetry]], well known throughout the second half of the 20th century. His work, though iconoclastic, remained well within the historical spectrum of poetry as it moved from a spoken tradition to the printed word and now back to the spoken word again (Wendt 1996, 112). He created a large body of pioneering recordings using early tape recorders, studio technologies and the sounds of the manipulated human voice. His emphasis on sound is a reminder that language stems as much from oral traditions as from classic literature, of the relationship of balance between order and chaos.  Chopin is significant above all for his diverse spread of creative achievement, as well as for his position as a focal point of contact for the international arts. As poet, painter, graphic artist and designer, typographer, independent publisher, filmmaker, broadcaster and arts promoter, Chopin's work is a barometer of the shifts in European media between the 1950s and the 1970s.   In 1964 he created ''OU'', one of the most notable reviews of the second half of the 20th century, and he ran it until 1974. ''OU'''s contributors included [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[Gil J Wolman]], François Dufrêne, [[Bernard Heidsieck]], John Furnival, Tom Phillips, and the Austrian sculptor, writer and [[Dada]] pioneer [[Raoul Hausmann]].  His books included ''Le Dernier Roman du Monde'' (1971), ''Portrait des 9'' (1975), ''The Cosmographical Lobster'' (1976), ''[[Poésie Sonore Internationale]]'' (1979), ''Les Riches Heures de l'Alphabet'' (1992) and ''[[Graphpoemesmachine]]'' (2006). Henri also created many graphic works on his typewriter: the typewriter poems (also known as dactylopoèmes) feature in international art collections such as those of Francesco Conz in Verona, the Morra Foundation in Naples and Ruth and Marvin Sackner in Miami, and have been the subject of Australian, British and French retrospectives (Aquaviva 2008).  His publication and design of the classic audio-visual magazines ''Cinquième Saison'' and ''OU'' between 1958 and 1974, each issue containing recordings as well as texts, images, screenprints and multiples, brought together international contemporary writers and artists such as members of [[Lettrisme]] and [[Fluxus]], [[Jiri Kolar]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[William S. Burroughs]] and many others, as well as bringing the work of survivors from earlier generations such as [[Raoul Hausmann]] and [[Marcel Janco]] to a fresh audience.  From 1968 to 1986 Henri Chopin lived in [[Ingatestone, Essex]], but with the death of his wife Jean in 1985, he moved back to France.  In 2001 with his health failing, he returned to England, living with his daughter and family at [[Dereham, Norfolk]] (Acquaviva 2008).  ==Aesthetics== Chopin's ''poesie sonore'' aesthetics included a deliberate cultivation of a ''barbarian'' approach in production, using raw or crude sound manipulations to explore the area between distortion and intelligibility. He avoided high-quality, professional recording machines, preferring to use very basic equipment and ''bricolage'' methods, such as sticking matchsticks in the erase heads of a second-hand tape recorder, or manually interfering with the tape path (Wendt 1985, 16–17).  == Books == *Chopin, Henri. 1979.

It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 8 elements]]. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[osmium]] in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with [[oxygen]] in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide. {{Good Article}}  ==History== {{see also|Discovery of the chemical elements}} [[File:Adenauerallee-2011-hessentag-099.jpg|thumb|left|250px|2011 [[Hessentag]] fair and festival in [[Hesse]]]] The synthesis of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research team led by [[Yuri Oganessian]] and [[Vladimir Utyonkov]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264.

They stated that the GSI collaboration was \"more detailed and, of itself, carries conviction\", and that while the combined data from Dubna and Darmstadt confirmed that hassium had been synthesized, the major credit was awarded to the GSI.

This does not rule out the possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or [[nuclear isomer]]s existing, some of which could still exist in [[trace radioisotope|trace]] quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities.

His findings were criticized by [[V. M.

In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5&nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different [[hyperdeformation|hyperdeformed]] states of a hassium isotope around <sup>271</sup>Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marinov |first1=A.|last2=Gelberg |first2=S. |last3=Kolb |first3=D. |last4=Brandt |first4=R. |last5=Pape |first5=A. |date=2003 |title=New outlook on the possible existence of superheavy elements in nature |journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1137–45 |doi=10.1134/1.1586428 |arxiv = nucl-ex/0210039 |bibcode = 2003PAN....66.1137M }}</ref>  In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research conducted a search for natural hassium.

Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiride if it occurred in nature.

This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life-times to spontaneous fission.<ref name=Focus/><ref name=Dvorak/> The spontaneous fission half-lives in this region are typically reduced by a factor of 10<sup>9</sup> in comparison with those in the vicinity of the spherical doubly magic nucleus <sup>298</sup>[[flerovium|Fl]], caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei.<ref name=Smolanczuk/> Hence, the nucleus <sup>270</sup>Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus.

During the experiment, 5 hassium atoms were synthesized using the reaction <sup>248</sup>Cm(<sup>26</sup>Mg,5n)<sup>269</sup>Hs.

For comparison, the value for OsO<sub>4</sub> is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol.<ref name=Haire/> It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals ([[silicon nitride]] and [[silicon dioxide]]) used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of <sup>269</sup>Hs and comparisons with RuO<sub>4</sub> in addition to OsO<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Haire/>  In 2004 scientists reacted hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate(VIII), a reaction well-known with osmium.

This compound is analogous to the lighter [[ferrocene]], [[ruthenocene]], and [[osmocene]], and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an [[eclipsed conformation]] like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a [[staggered conformation]] like ferrocene.<ref name=\"hassocene\"/> Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in [[metallocene]]s) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state.<ref name=\"hassocene\"/> Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier.

It was first depicted on a [[celestial atlas]] by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  charted the brighter stars and gave their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. Its name means \"male water snake\", as opposed to [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.  The brightest star is the 2.8-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] [[Beta Hydri]], also the closest reasonably bright star to the [[pole star#Southern pole star (South Star)|south celestial pole]]. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, [[Gamma Hydri]] is a variable [[red giant]] some 60 times the diameter of our [[Sun]]. Lying near it is [[VW Hydri]], one of the brightest [[dwarf nova]]e in the heavens. Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date, most notably [[HD 10180]], which could bear up to nine planetary companions.  ==History== [[File:Johann Bayer - Uraniometria - Southern Birds.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Hydrus (lower right) in an extract from [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'', its first appearance in a celestial atlas.]] Hydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].

In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.  The Romans adapted the Greek hero's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.<ref>\"Hercules,\" in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.</ref> This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].  ==Labours== [[File:Antonio del Pollaiolo - Ercole e l'Idra e Ercole e Anteo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Hercules and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]'' (ca. 1475) by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]; the hero wears his characteristic lionskin and wields a club]] [[File:Heracles and the Erymantian boar.jpg|thumb|upright|Hercules capturing the [[Erymanthian Boar]], by [[:es:José Manuel Félix Magdalena|J.M.

One cycle of these adventures became [[Western canon|canonical]] as the \"Twelve Labours,\" but the list has variations. One traditional order of the labours is found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' as follows:<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.5.1-2.5.12.</ref> # Slay the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]]. # Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]]. # Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind|Golden Hind of Artemis]]. # Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]]. # Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day. # Slay the [[Stymphalian birds|Stymphalian Birds]]. # Capture the [[Cretan Bull]]. # Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]]. # Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the [[Amazons]]. # Obtain the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]]. # Steal the apples of the [[Hesperides]]. # Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].  ===Side adventures=== Hercules had a greater number of \"[[Heracles#Further adventures|deeds on the side]]\" ''(parerga)'' that have been popular subjects for art, including:<!--the following are organized chronologically by their creation as art works, not in any order pertaining to Hercules' deeds--> <gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Side adventures\"> File:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|Killing a fire-breathing [[Cacus]] ([[Sebald Beham]], 1545) File:Taten des Herakles dt 16Jh Atlas.jpg|Holding up the world for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (based on [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], 1550) File:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|Wrestling with [[Achelous]] (16th-century plaque) File:Herakles Antaeus Couder decoration Louvre INV3378.jpg|Fighting the giant [[Antaeus]] ([[Auguste Couder]], 1819) File:Paul Cézanne 045.jpg|Retrieving [[Alcestis]] from the underworld ([[Paul Cézanne]], 1867) File:Prometheus and Hercules.jpg|Freeing [[Prometheus]] ([[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1878) </gallery>  ==Roman era== {{Main|Hercules in ancient Rome}} [[File:Greek - Aged Herakles - Walters 54764.jpg|thumb|left|This Roman statuette is a copy after a Greek original that depicts the hero at an advanced age. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]] The [[Latin]] name ''Hercules'' was borrowed through [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], where it is represented variously as [[Hercle|Heracle]], Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''<!--is this right?--> derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]. A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].<ref>W. M.

One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]\", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211.</ref> The comic playwright [[Plautus]] presents the myth of Hercules' conception as a sex comedy in his play ''[[Amphitryon (play)|Amphitryon]]''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote the tragedy ''Hercules Furens'' about his bout with madness. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], Hercules was worshipped locally from [[Hispania]] through [[Gaul]].  ===Germanic association=== [[Tacitus]] records a special affinity of the [[Germanic peoples]] for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states: <blockquote> ''... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''<ref>or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants. In the 17th century, the word entered the German language as ''barditus'' and was associated with the Celtic [[bard]]s.</ref> as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.'' </blockquote>  Some have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic ''[[Thor|Þunraz]]'' with Hercules by way of ''interpretatio romana''.<ref>Simek, Rudolf (2007:140—142) translated by Angela Hall. Dictionary of Northern Mythology.  D.S. Brewer. ISBN 0-85991-513-1</ref>  In the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[Köln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.  In the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic \"[[Donar]]'s Clubs\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals.They are found exclusively in female graves, apparently worn either as a belt pendant, or as an ear pendant. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.  ==Medieval mythography== [[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']] After the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.<ref>[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395]; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.</ref>  In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, with the monsters he battles as moral obstacles.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.</ref> One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.</ref>  Medieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.  ==Renaissance mythography== The [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages: <blockquote> Hercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref> </blockquote>  ==In art== In Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.<ref>''Hercules'' almost suggests \"Hero\". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu], jpg file.

In 966 AD, Duke [[Mieszko I]] of the [[Piast dynasty]] [[Baptism of Poland|adopted Western Christianity]]; in 1025 Mieszko's son [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] formally established a [[High Middle Ages|medieval kingdom]]. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th-16th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and territorial expansion that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569.  The Commonwealth in its early phase represented a continuation of Jagiellonian prosperity, with its remarkable development of a sophisticated [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]]. From the mid-17th century the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and by the deterioration of the country's political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced during the later part of the 18th century, especially in the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reform process to continue. The independent existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]].  From 1795 until 1918 no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795–1918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. After the failure of the last military uprising against the Russian Empire, the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, the nation preserved its identity through educational initiatives and through the program of \"[[organic work]]\" intended to modernize the economy and society. The opportunity to regain independence only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers suffered decline in the wake of war and revolution.  The [[Second Polish Republic]], established in 1918, existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] destroyed it in their [[invasion of Poland]] at the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 as Germany classified ethnic [[Poles]] and other [[Slavs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsies) as [[Untermensch|subhuman]]. Nazi authorities targeted the last two groups for [[the Holocaust|extermination in the short term]], deferring the extermination and/or enslavement of the Slavs as part of the \"[[Generalplan Ost]]\" (\"General Plan for the East\") conceived by the Nazi régime. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns, including the final anti-German offensives, on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[communism|communist]] [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].  As a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the victorious Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|traditional multi-ethnic]] character through the extermination, expulsion and migration of the various nationalities during and after the war.  By the late 1980s the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[communist state]] to the [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and to [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|modern Polish state]]—the Polish Third Republic.  ==Prehistory and protohistory==  {{Further2|[[Prehistory and protohistory of Poland]], [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages]]}}  [[File:Biskupin - gate and wall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]  Members of the ''[[Homo]]'' [[genus]] have lived in north [[Central Europe]] for thousands of years since its environment was altered by prehistoric [[glacial period|glaciation]].

The [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812 and the [[German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)|German campaign of 1813]] saw the Duchy's last military engagements. The [[Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw]] abolished serfdom as a reflection of the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], but it did not promote [[land reform]].<ref name=\"Gierowski 130–147\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=130–147}}.</ref>  ====Congress of Vienna====  [[File:Death of Poniatowski.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|[[Józef Poniatowski]]'s leap into the [[Weisse Elster|Elster]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] to some epitomized Poland's fate]]  After Napoleon's defeat, a new European order was established at the [[Congress of Vienna]].

The [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|Greater Poland Uprising]] ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the [[Kraków Uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the Republic of Kraków into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the [[Galician slaughter]] (1846),<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> a large-scale rebellion of [[serfdom|serf]]s seeking relief from their post-feudal ''[[folwark]]'' [[serfdom in Poland|condition of slavery]]. The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|peasant enfranchisement]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] (1848). A new wave of Polish military and other involvement, in the partitions and in other parts of Europe (e.g. [[Józef Bem]] [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|in Austria]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]]), soon took place in the context of the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions. In particular, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|events in Berlin]] precipitated the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]],<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> where peasants in the Prussian Partition, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.<ref name=\"Gierowski 232–287\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=232–287}}.</ref>  ====Uprising of January 1863====  [[File:Romuald Traugutt 111.PNG|thumb|175px|right|[[Romuald Traugutt]], last \"dictator\" of the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]]]  Despite the limited liberalization measures allowed in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] under the rule of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], a renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860–61. During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or left-wing faction, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with the Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or right-wing faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the Kingdom's government, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The war lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287–311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287–311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwień, czerń\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>  On 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the Uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|an enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]]<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the capitalist system on central Polish lands. At the time when the futility of armed resistance without external support was realized by most Poles, the various sections of Polish society were undergoing deep and far-reaching social, economic and cultural changes.<ref name=\"Biel, czerwień, czerń\"/><ref name=\"Gierowski 311–318\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=311–318}}.</ref>  ===Formation of modern Polish society under foreign rule (1864–1914)===  ====Repression and organic work====  [[File:Prus 002.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Bolesław Prus]] (1847–1912), a leading novelist, journalist and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Positivism|philosopher]] of Poland's [[Positivism in Poland|post-1863 Uprising period]]]]  The failure of the January Uprising in Poland caused a major psychological trauma and became a historic watershed; indeed, it sparked the development of modern [[Polish nationalism]]. The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, preserved their identity in non-violent ways. After the Uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The Russian and German languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression; public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanization]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in Polish was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in western Ukraine and southern Poland, experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 allowed increasingly limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Stańczycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning|Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences]] was founded in Kraków in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> [[Positivism in Poland|Positivism]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182–187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182–187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192–194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192–194}}.</ref>  Social activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and worked on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses: industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods and ways of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through trade associations and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was the educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals reflected the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182–187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84–85}}.</ref>  ====Economic development and social change====  [[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]  Under the partitioning powers, large-scale [[industrialization]], economic diversification and progress were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. In the Prussian Partition, advanced agriculture was practiced, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns was taking place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture. Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[Łódź]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of the urban population, making the region the most advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. Galician economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lwów, Lviv)]] and [[Kraków]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187–192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187–192, 199}}.</ref>  [[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated, but most remained and constituted a large minority on Polish-Lithuanian lands]]  Economic and social changes involving land reform and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business middle class, often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new underprivileged class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various [[ethnic group]]s worked or settled in Europe and in North and South America.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187–192, 199\"/>  Social and economic changes were partial and gradual, and the degree of (fast-paced in some areas) industrialization generally lagged behind the advanced regions of western Europe. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other (for example the Prussian Partition's agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market).<ref name=\"Lukowski 187–192, 199\"/>  ====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====  [[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked [[Revolution of 1905|in 1905]]|thumb|left|275px]]  In the 1870s–90s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|SDKPiL]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including Ukrainians, Lithuanians, [[Belarusians]] and Jews, were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194–203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194–203}}.</ref>  Around the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207–209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207–209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>  ====Revolution of 1905====  [[File:Roman Dmowski.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential; he wanted a Polish speaking Catholic nation with little concern for minorities and the expulsion of Jews]]  The [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–07)|Revolution of 1905–07 in Russian Poland]],<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> the result of many years of pent-up political frustrations and stifled national ambitions, was marked by political maneuvering, strikes and rebellion. The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general [[Revolution of 1905]]. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Piłsudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. Some of the acquired gains were, however, rolled back,<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=140}}.</ref> which coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory most amenable to patriotic action.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203–208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203–208}}.</ref>  In the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, higher standards of developed civilization were achieved, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in core central and western Poland, over a relatively small and compact territory. Much fewer were spread in the east: 1.3 million in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Eastern Galicia]] and about 2 million along Russia's western districts, with the heaviest concentration in the [[Vilnius Region]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 208–216\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=208–216}}.</ref>   Polish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the [[Union of Active Struggle]], were being formed in 1908–14, mainly in Galicia.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Piłsudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914, and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], they fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Piłsudski, who refused the demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217–222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217–222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279–290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279–290}}</ref>  [[File:KNP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dmowski presented his exile [[Polish National Committee (1917–19)|Polish National Committee]] as the legitimate Polish representation, but the liberating events in Poland took place according to their own dynamics]]  Due to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915. In the [[Act of 5th November]] 1916, a fresh incarnation of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)|Kingdom of Poland]] (''Królestwo Regencyjne'') was created by Germany and Austria on formerly Russian-controlled territories<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> within the German [[Mitteleuropa]] scheme. The sponsor states were never able to agree on a candidate to assume the throne, however; rather, it was governed in turn by German and Austrian Governor-Generals, a [[Provisional Council of State]], and a [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]].  This puppet, but increasingly autonomous state existed until November 1918, when it was replaced by the newly established [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The existence of this \"kingdom\" and its planned Polish army had a positive effect on the Polish national efforts on the [[Triple Entente|Allied side]]. But the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (March 1918) between Germany and defeated Russia ignored Polish interests.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217–222\"/><ref name=\"playground II 279–290\"/>  The independence of Poland had been campaigned for in Russia and in the West by Dmowski and in the West by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]]. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], and then the leaders of the [[February Revolution]] and the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, installed governments who declared in turn their support for Polish independence.<ref name=\"playground II 279–290\"/> In 1917, France formed the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] (placed under [[Józef Haller]]) that comprised about 70,000 Poles by the end of the war, including men captured from German and Austrian units and 20,000 volunteers from the U.S. There was also a 30,000-men strong Polish anti-German army in Russia. Dmowski, operating from Paris as head of the [[Polish National Committee (1917–19)|Polish National Committee]] (KNP), became the spokesman for Polish nationalism in the Allied camp.

With the end of the war, Austro-Hungarian and German units were being disarmed, and the Austrian army's collapse freed [[Cieszyn]] and Kraków at the end of October. Lviv was then contested in the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] of 1918–19. [[Ignacy Daszyński]] headed the first short-lived independent Polish government in [[Lublin]] from November 7, the leftist Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland, which was proclaimed as a democracy. Germany, now defeated, was forced by the Allies to stand down its large military forces in Poland. Overtaken by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] at home, the Germans released Piłsudski from prison. He arrived in Warsaw on November 10 and was granted extensive authority by the Kingdom's [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]], which was also recognized by the Lublin government.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> On November 22 Piłsudski became the temporary head of state.

According to the language criterion of the [[Polish census of 1931]], the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the [[Yiddish language]]) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291–321\"/>  The population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there.<ref name=\"playground 291–321\"/> Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 millions in 1919 to 34.8 millions in 1939),<ref name=\"playground 291–321\"/> the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 18%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=360}}.</ref>  Conditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to [[Norman Davies]], the failures of the Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more destructive precedents of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Stalinism|Soviet Union under Stalin]].<ref name=\"playground 291–321\"/>  ===Final years===  [[File:Beck and hitler.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Józef Beck]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1937.

Beck had numerous foreign policy schemes and harbored illusions of Poland's status as a great power. He alienated most of Poland's neighbors, but is not blamed by historians for the ultimate failure of relations with Germany. The principal events of his tenure were concentrated in its last two years.

Balcerowicz's policies also caused permanent damage to Polish agriculture, which Balcerowicz \"did not understand\", and to the often successful and useful Polish [[cooperative]] movement.<ref name=\"Stelmachowski 125–130\"/><ref name=\"TINA to fałsz\">{{Harvnb|Kuczyński|2014}}.</ref>  ''w.''{{Note label|w|w|none}}Led by [[Władysław Anders]], the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] fought at the famous [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in 1944, as part of the Allied [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brzoza|2001|p=368}}.</ref>  ''x.''{{Note label|x|x|none}}The concept which had become known as the [[Piast Idea]], the chief proponent of which was [[Jan Ludwik Popławski]], was based on the statement that the [[Piast]] homeland was inhabited by so-called \"native\" aboriginal Slavs and Slavonic Poles since time immemorial and only later was \"infiltrated\" by \"alien\" [[Celts]], [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] and others. After 1945, the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing in Poland and a considerable degree of popular support. According to this view, the [[Lusatian Culture]] which archaeologists have identified between the [[Oder]] and the [[Vistula]] in the early [[Iron Age]], was said to be Slavonic; all non-Slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times were dismissed as \"migrants\" and \"visitors\". In contrast, the critics of this theory, such as [[Marija Gimbutas]], regarded it as an unproved hypotheses and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the Slavs were largely uncharted; the Slavonic connections of the Lusatian Culture were entirely imaginary; and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the [[North European Plain]] was taken for granted.<ref name=\"Davies Acta Iaponica Heritage\">{{Harvnb|Davies|1986|pp=79–87}}.</ref>  {{refend}}  ==References==  === Citations === {{reflist|colwidth=30em}} === Bibliography === {{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}} :{{Cite book   |last= Applebaum  |first= Anne  |authorlink= Anne Applebaum  |year= 2012   |title= Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944–56   |location= London  |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Allen Lane]]   |isbn= 978-0-713-99868-9  |ref= harv  }} :{{Cite book   |last= Barker  |first= Philip W.  |year= 2008   |title= Religious Nationalism in Modern Europe: If God be for Us   |location= Abingdon and New York, NY  |publisher= [[Routledge]]   |isbn= 978-0-415-77514-4  |ref= harv }} :{{Cite book   |last= Berghahn  |first= Volker R.  |year= 1999   |chapter= Germans and Poles, 1871–1945   |title= ''In Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J.

The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[African-American]]s lived near the city before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.

Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.

Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, while the heads flew about 250 micro-inches above the platter surface.  Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning.  The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes.  Access time was about 200 milliseconds.  In 1962, IBM introduced the [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk drive, which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable [[disk pack]]. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of [[magnetic tape]]. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called \"fixed disk\" drives.  Some high-performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track (e.g. [[IBM 2305]]) so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track.<ref>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Guide 1995, Chapter 17 – Disk and File System Basics</ref> Known as fixed-head or head-per-track disk drives they were very expensive and are no longer in production.<ref>Computer Organization and Design, 2nd Ed., P. Pal Chaudhuri, 2006, p. 635</ref>  In 1973, IBM introduced a new type of HDD codenamed [[IBM 3340|\"Winchester\"]]. Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to \"land\" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, \"taking off\" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of \"Winchester technology\" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later \"Winchester\" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.  Like the first removable pack drive, the first \"Winchester\" drives used platters {{convert|14|in}} in diameter. A few years later, designers were exploring the possibility that physically smaller platters might offer advantages. Drives with non-removable eight-inch platters appeared, and then drives that used a {{convert|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} [[#Form factors|form factor]] (a mounting width equivalent to that used by contemporary [[floppy disk drive]]s). The latter were primarily intended for the then-fledgling personal computer (PC) market.  As the 1980s began, HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs, but by the late 1980s their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers.  Most HDDs in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users as an external, add-on subsystem. The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer's name but under the subsystem manufacturer's name such as [[Corvus Systems]] and [[Tallgrass Technologies]], or under the PC system manufacturer's name such as the [[Apple ProFile]]. The [[IBM PC/XT]] in 1983 included an internal 10&nbsp;MB HDD, and soon thereafter internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers.  External HDDs remained popular for much longer on the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Every Macintosh made between 1986 and 1998 had a [[SCSI]] port on the back, making external expansion simple; also, older compact Macintosh computers did not have easily accessible hard drive bays (or in the case of the [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]], and [[Macintosh Plus]], any hard drive bay at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option.  The [[2011 Thailand floods]] damaged the manufacturing plants and impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between 2011 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://blog.backblaze.com/2012/10/09/backblaze_drive_farming/  | title = Farming hard drives: how Backblaze weathered the Thailand drive crisis  | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2014-05-23  | website = blaze.com }}</ref>  Driven by ever increasing [[memory storage density|areal density]] since their invention, HDDs have continuously improved their characteristics; a few highlights are listed in the table above. At the same time, market application expanded from [[mainframe computer]]s of the late 1950s to most [[mass storage]] applications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content.  == Technology == [[File:magneticMedia.svg|thumb|Magnetic cross section & [[frequency modulation]] encoded binary data]]  === Magnetic recording === {{See also|Magnetic storage}}  An HDD records data by magnetizing a thin film of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material{{Efn|Initially gamma iron oxide particles in an epoxy binder, the recording layer in a modern HDD typically is domains of a granular Cobalt-Chrome-Platinum-based alloy physically isolated by an oxide to enable [[perpendicular recording]].<ref>[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.5543.pdf New Paradigms in Magnetic Recording]</ref>}} on a disk. Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent binary data [[bit]]s. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as [[run-length limited]] encoding,{{Efn|Historically a variety of run-length limited codes have been used in magnetic recording including for example, codes named [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] and [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] which are no longer used in modern HDDs.}} which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.  A typical HDD design consists of a ''{{visible anchor|spindle|Spindle}}'' that holds flat circular disks, also called [[hard disk platter|platters]], which hold the recorded data. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy, glass, or ceramic, and are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10–20 [[nanometer|nm]] in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection.<ref name=\"headcrash\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-6\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-7\" /> For reference, a standard piece of copy paper is {{convert|0.07|-|0.18|mm|nm|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"AutoMK-8\" />  [[File:Hard drive-en.svg|thumb|left|Diagram labeling the major components of a computer HDD]] [[File:Aufnahme einzelner Magnetisierungen gespeicherter Bits auf einem Festplatten-Platter..jpg|thumb|Recording of single magnetisations of bits on a 200&nbsp;MB HDD-platter (recording made visible using CMOS-MagView).<ref name=\"AutoMK-9\" />]] [[File:Perpendicular Recording Diagram.svg|thumb|[[Longitudinal recording]] (standard) & [[perpendicular recording]] diagram]]  The platters in contemporary HDDs are spun at speeds varying from 4,200&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] in energy-efficient portable devices, to 15,000&nbsp;rpm for high-performance servers.<ref name=\"AutoMK-10\" /> The first HDDs spun at 1,200&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"IBM350\" /> and, for many years, 3,600&nbsp;rpm was the norm.<ref name=\"AutoMK-12\" /> As of December 2013, the platters in most consumer-grade HDDs spin at either 5,400&nbsp;rpm or 7,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing High Performance Storage is not about RPM any more|url=http://www.seagate.com/in/en/tech-insights/choosing-high-performance-storage-is-not-about-rpm-anymore-master-ti/|publisher=Seagate|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref>  Information is written to and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write heads]] that are positioned to operate very close to the magnetic surface, with their [[flying height]] often in the range of tens of nanometers. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material passing immediately under it.  In modern drives there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a [[voice coil]] actuator or in some older designs a [[stepper motor]]. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having the same amount of data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use [[zone bit recording]]—increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.  In modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of [[superparamagnetism|thermal effects]], thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the \"[[superparamagnetic limit]]\". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element [[ruthenium]], and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.<ref name=\"AutoMK-15\" /> Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is [[perpendicular recording]], first shipped in 2005,<ref name=\"AutoMK-16\" /> and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.<ref name=\"AutoMK-17\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-18\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-19\" />  In 2004, a new concept was introduced to allow further increase of the data density in magnetic recording, using recording media consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. That so-called ''[[exchange spring media]]'', also known as ''exchange coupled composite media'', allows good writability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. However, the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer.<ref name=AutoMK-19a /><ref name=AutoMK-19b />  === Components === [[File:Hard disk dismantled.jpg|thumb|left|HDD with disks and motor hub removed exposing copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing in the center of the spindle motor. Orange stripe along the side of the arm is thin printed-circuit cable, spindle bearing is in the center and the actuator is in the upper left]]  A typical HDD has two electric motors; a spindle motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 [[g-force|''g'']].  [[File:Kopftraeger WD2500JS-00MHB0.jpg|thumb|Head stack with an actuator coil on the left and read/write heads on the right]]  The ''{{visible anchor|actuator|Actuator}}'' is a [[permanent magnet]] and [[moving coil]] motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat [[neodymium magnet|neodymium-iron-boron]] (NIB) high-flux [[magnet]]. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the ''[[voice coil]]'' by analogy to the coil in [[loudspeaker]]s, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives only have one magnet).  The voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, and made of doubly coated copper [[magnet wire]]. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) interact with the [[magnetic field]], developing a tangential force that rotates the actuator. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the [[magnetic field#Force on a charged particle|tangential force]]. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.  The HDD's electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the [[disk controller]]. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.  === {{anchor|ERRORRATESHANDLING}}Error rates and handling === Modern drives make extensive use of [[forward error correction|error correction codes]] (ECCs), particularly [[Reed–Solomon error correction]]. These techniques store extra bits, determined by mathematical formulas, for each block of data; the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly. The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity.<ref name=\"AutoMK-20\" /> For example, a typical 1&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GB]] for the [[Forward error correction|ECC]] data.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.idema.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/12/AF-in-Legacy-Infrastructures-SDC2011_IDEMA-AF.pdf  | title = Advanced Format in Legacy Infrastructures: More Transparent than Disruptive  | format = PDF | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2013-11-05  | author = Curtis E.

This information is available from the manufacturer's specification and from the drive itself through use of special utilities invoking low level commands.<ref name=\"SAS\" /><ref name=\"SATA\" />  The gross capacity of older HDDs may be calculated as the product of the number of [[cylinder (disk drive)|cylinders]] per zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of [[Zone bit recording|zones]] of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report [[cylinder-head-sector]] (CHS) values, but these are not actual physical parameters since the reported numbers are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by [[logical block addressing]]. In some cases, to try to \"force-fit\" the CHS scheme to large-capacity drives, the number of heads was given as 64, although no modern drive has anywhere near 32 platters: the typical 2&nbsp;TB hard disk as of 2013 has two 1&nbsp;TB platters, and 4&nbsp;TB drives use four platters.  In modern HDDs, spare capacity for defect management is not included in the published capacity; however, in many early HDDs a certain number of sectors were reserved as spares, thereby reducing the capacity available to end users.  For [[RAID]] subsystems, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID1 subsystem will be about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring. RAID5 subsystems with x drives, would lose 1/x of capacity to parity. RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provides a great deal of fault-tolerance. Most RAID vendors use some form of [[checksum]]s to improve data integrity at the block level. For many vendors, this involves using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes per sector to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes or using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.<ref name=\"AutoMK-38\" />  In some systems, there may be hidden [[disk partitioning|partitions]] used for system recovery that reduce the capacity available to the end user.  === System use === {{Main|Disk formatting}}  The presentation of a hard disk drive to its host is determined by the [[disk controller]]. The actual presentation may differ substantially from the drive's native [[interface (computing)|interface]], particularly in [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] or [[server computer|servers]]. Modern HDDs, such as SAS<ref name=\"SAS\" /> and SATA<ref name=\"SATA\" /> drives, appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of logical blocks that are typically 512 bytes long, though the industry is in the process of changing to the 4,096-byte logical blocks layout, known as the [[Advanced Format]] (AF).<ref name=\"AutoMK-35\" />  The process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called ''low-level formatting'', which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html|title=Low-Level Formatting|publisher=}}</ref>{{Efn|However, some enterprise SAS drives have other block sizes such as 520, 524 and 528 bytes, which can be changed in the field.}} As a next step in preparing an HDD for use, ''high-level formatting'' writes [[Disk partitioning|partition]] and [[file system]] structures into selected logical blocks to make the remaining logical blocks available to the host's [[operating system]] and its applications.<ref name=\"AutoMK-37\" /> The file system uses some of the disk space to structure the HDD and organize files, recording their file names and the sequence of disk areas that represent the file. Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) in the [[DOS]] file system and [[inode]]s in many [[UNIX]] file systems, as well as other operating system data structures (also known as [[metadata]]). As a consequence, not all the space on an HDD is available for user files, but this system overhead is usually negligible.  === Units === {{See also|Binary prefix#Disk drives}}  {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-left: 1.5em;\" |+ Decimal and binary [[unit prefix]]es interpretation<ref name=\"SeagateStorageGuide\" /><ref name=\"WD2\" /> ! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity advertised by manufacturers{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"|Expressed using [[SI prefix#List of SI prefixes|decimal&nbsp;multiples]].}} ! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity expected by some consumers{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"|Expressed using [[binary prefix|binary&nbsp;multiples]].}} ! colspan=2 | Reported capacity |- ! rowspan=2 | [[Windows]]{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"}} ! rowspan=2 | [[OS&nbsp;X]]<br />10.6+{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"}} |- !

Internally, computers do not represent either hard disk drive or memory capacity in powers of 1,024, but reporting it in this manner is a convention.<ref name=\"Apple\" /> The [[Microsoft Windows]] family of operating systems uses the binary convention when reporting storage capacity, so an HDD offered by its manufacturer as a 1&nbsp;TB drive is reported by these operating systems as a 931&nbsp;GB HDD.

to an older 5.25-inch full-height 110&nbsp;MB HDD]]  IBM's first hard drive, the [[IBM 350]], used a stack of fifty 24-inch platters and was of a size comparable to two large refrigerators. In 1962, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk, which used six 14-inch (nominal size) platters in a removable pack and was roughly the size of a washing machine. This became a standard platter size and drive form-factor for many years, used also by other manufacturers.<ref name=\"AutoMK-39\" /> The [[IBM 2314]] used platters of the same size in an eleven-high pack and introduced the \"drive in a drawer\" layout, although the \"drawer\" was not the complete drive.  Later drives were designed to fit entirely into a chassis that would mount in a [[19-inch rack]]. Digital's [[RK05]] and RL01 were early examples using single 14-inch platters in removable packs, the entire drive fitting in a 10.5-inch-high rack space (six rack units).  In the mid-to-late 1980s the similarly sized [[Fujitsu Eagle]], which used (coincidentally) 10.5-inch platters, was a popular product.  Such large platters were never used with microprocessor-based systems.  With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in [[floppy disk|floppy-disk drives (FDDs)]], HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD ''Form factors'', initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.  ; {{Anchor|8 inch}}8-inch : {{val|9.5|u=in}} × {{val|4.624|u=in}} × {{val|14.25|u=in}} ({{val|241.3|u=mm}} × {{val|117.5|u=mm}} × {{val|362|u=mm}}). In 1979, [[Shugart Associates]]' SA1000 was the first form factor compatible HDD, having the same dimensions and a compatible interface to the 8\" FDD. ; {{Anchor|5.25 inch}}5.25-inch : 5.75&nbsp;in × 3.25&nbsp;in × 8&nbsp;in (146.1&nbsp;mm × 82.55&nbsp;mm × 203&nbsp;mm). This smaller form factor, first used in an HDD by Seagate in 1980,<ref name=\"AutoMK-40\" /> was the same size as full-height {{convert|5+1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} FDD, 3.25-inches high.

While these sizes are customarily described by an approximately correct figure in inches, actual sizes have long been specified in millimeters.  == Performance characteristics == {{Main|Hard disk drive performance characteristics}}  === Time to access data === The factors that limit the [[Access time|time to access the data]] on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads. [[Seek time]] is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. [[Disk drive performance characteristics#Rotational latency|Rotational latency]] is incurred because the desired disk sector may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested. These two delays are on the order of milliseconds each. The [[bit rate]] or data transfer rate (once the head is in the right position) creates delay which is a function of the number of blocks transferred; typically relatively small, but can be quite long with the transfer of large contiguous files. Delay may also occur if the drive disks are stopped to save energy.  An HDD's ''Average Access Time'' is its average [[seek time]] which technically is the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.<ref name=\"AutoMK-66\" />  [[Defragmentation]] is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" /> Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically. Although automatic defragmentation is intended to reduce access delays, performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress.<ref name=\"AutoMK-67\" />  [[Access time|Time to access data]] can be improved by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) or by reducing the time spent seeking. Increasing areal density increases [[throughput]] by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. The time to access data has not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.  === {{anchor|SEEKTIME}}Seek time === {{See also|Hard disk drive performance characteristics#SEEKTIME|l1=Hard disk drive performance characteristics: Seek time}}  Average [[seek time]] ranges from under 4&nbsp;[[millisecond|ms]] for high-end server drives<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/3636/western-digitals-new-velociraptor-vr200m-10k-rpm-at-450gb-and-600gb  | title = Western Digital's New VelociRaptor VR200M: 10K&nbsp;RPM at 450GB and 600GB  | date = 2010-04-06 | accessdate = 2013-12-19  | author = Anand Lal Shimpi | website = anandtech.com }}</ref> to 15&nbsp;ms for mobile drives, with the most common mobile drives at about 12&nbsp;ms<ref name=\"WD-Scorpio Blue-specs\" /> and the most common desktop type typically being around 9&nbsp;ms. The first HDD had an average seek time of about 600&nbsp;ms;<ref name=\"IBM350\" /> by the middle of 1970s HDDs were available with seek times of about 25&nbsp;ms.<ref name=\"AutoMK-70\" /> Some early PC drives used a [[stepper motor]] to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120&nbsp;ms, but this was quickly improved by [[voice coil]] type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20&nbsp;ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time.  Some desktop and laptop computer systems allow the user to make a tradeoff between seek performance and drive noise. Faster seek rates typically require more energy usage to quickly move the heads across the platter, causing louder noises from the pivot bearing and greater device vibrations as the heads are rapidly accelerated during the start of the seek motion and decelerated at the end of the seek motion. Quiet operation reduces movement speed and acceleration rates, but at a cost of reduced seek performance.  === Latency === {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\" |- ! Rotational speed<br />[rpm] ! Average latency<br />[ms] |- | 15,000 | 2 |- | 10,000 | 3 |- | 7,200 | 4.16 |- | 5,400 | 5.55 |- | 4,800 | 6.25 |}  Latency is the delay for the rotation of the disk to bring the required [[disk sector]] under the read-write mechanism. It depends on rotational speed of a disk, measured in [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). Average rotational latency is shown in the table on the right, based on the statistical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period.  === Data transfer rate === {{As of|2010}}, a typical 7,200-rpm desktop HDD has a sustained \"disk-to-[[disk buffer|buffer]]\" data transfer rate up to 1,030&nbsp;[[Mbits/sec]].<ref name=\"AutoMK-71\" /> This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000-rpm drives. A current widely used standard for the \"buffer-to-computer\" interface is 3.0&nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by [[file system fragmentation]] and the layout of the files.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" />  HDD data transfer rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk and the number of sectors per track, only the latter increases the data transfer rate for a given rpm. Since data transfer rate performance only tracks one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  === Other considerations === Other performance considerations include quality-adjusted [[price index|price]], power consumption, audible noise, and shock resistance.  The [[Federal Reserve Board]] has a quality-adjusted [[price index]] for large scale enterprise storage systems including three or more enterprise HDDs and associated controllers, racks and cables. Prices for these large scale storage systems improved at the rate of ‒30% per year during 2004–2009 and ‒22% per year during 2009–2014.<ref name=\"Byrne2015b\"/>  == Access and interfaces == {{Main|Hard disk drive interface}} [[File:Seagate ST33232A hard disk inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a 1998 [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] HDD that used [[Parallel ATA]] interface]] [[File:2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors.jpg|thumb|right|2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors]]  HDDs are accessed over one of a number of [[bus (computing)|bus]] types, including {{As of|2011|lc=on}} parallel [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] (PATA, also called IDE or [[AT Attachment#EIDE and ATA-2|EIDE]]; described before the introduction of SATA as ATA), [[Serial ATA]] (SATA), [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), and [[Fibre Channel]]. Bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect HDDs to buses with which they cannot communicate natively, such as [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE&nbsp;1394]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]].  Modern HDDs present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses [[partial response maximum likelihood|PRML]] and [[Reed–Solomon error correction]]<ref name=\"AutoMK-79\" /> to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by [[error detection and correction]], and performs [[bad sector]] remapping, data collection for [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology]], and other internal tasks.  Modern interfaces connect an HDD to a host bus interface adapter (today typically integrated into the \"[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]\") with one data/control cable. Each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit. * [[Small Computer System Interface]] (SCSI), originally named SASI for Shugart Associates System Interface, was standard on servers, workstations, [[Amiga peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] computers through the mid-1990s, by which time most models had been transitioned to IDE (and later, SATA) family disks. The range limitations of the data cable allows for external SCSI devices. * [[Integrated Drive Electronics]] (IDE), later standardized under the name [[AT Attachment]] (ATA, with the alias P-ATA or PATA ([[Parallel ATA]]) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA) moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive. This helped to standardize the host/controller interface, reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver, and reduced system cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16&nbsp;bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the HDD led to an \"ultra DMA\" mode, known as [[AT Attachment#Parallel ATA interface|UDMA]]. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for an 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross talk]]. * EIDE was an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original IDE standard, with the key improvement being the use of [[direct memory access]] (DMA) to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the [[central processing unit|CPU]], an improvement later adopted by the official ATA standards. By directly transferring data between memory and disk, DMA eliminates the need for the CPU to copy byte per byte, therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs. * [[Fibre Channel]] (FC) is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the [[Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop]] (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it is the cornerstone of [[storage area network]]s (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like [[iSCSI]] and [[ATA over Ethernet]] have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use ''copper'' twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or [[disk array controller]]s. * [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands. * [[Serial ATA]] (SATA). The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like [[EIA-422]]. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar [[differential signaling]] system is used in [[RS485]], [[LocalTalk]], [[USB]], [[FireWire]], and differential [[SCSI]].  == Integrity and failure == [[File:Hard disk head.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an HDD head resting on a disk platter; its mirror reflection is visible on the platter surface.]] {{Main|Hard disk drive failure|Data recovery}}  Due to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, HDDs are vulnerable to being damaged by a [[head crash]]—a [[hard disk failure|failure]] of the disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, [[corrosion]], or poorly manufactured platters and heads.  The HDD's spindle system relies on [[air density]] inside the [[disk enclosure]] to support the heads at their proper [[flying height]] while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5&nbsp;mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the ''breather filter'').<ref name=\"AutoMK-80\" /> If the air density is too low, then there is not enough lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AutoMK-81\" /> Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives—they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or \"recirc\") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.  For [[giant magnetoresistive effect|giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) heads in particular, a minor head crash from contamination (that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk) still results in the head temporarily overheating, due to friction with the disk surface, and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes (so called \"thermal asperity\", a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal).  When the logic board of a hard disk fails, the drive can often be restored to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board of one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-to-tech/how-to-recover-data-hard-drive4.htm|title=How To Recover Lost Data from Your Hard Drive|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|publisher=HowStuffWorks|pages=5–6|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref> For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including [[fsck]] on [[UNIX-like]] systems and [[CHKDSK]] on [[Windows]], can be used for [[data recovery]].

Known as a [[Magical organization|magical order]], the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in [[Great Britain]] and focused its practices on [[theurgy]] and spiritual development.  Many present-day concepts of ritual and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as [[Wicca]]<ref name=Colquhoun>[[Ithell Colquhoun|Colquhoun, Ithell]] (1975) ''The Sword of Wisdom: MacGregor Mathers & the Golden Dawn''. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons.</ref><ref>Phillips, Julia (1991) [http://www.geraldgardner.com/History_of_Wicca_Revised.pdf ''History of Wicca in England: 1939 - present day''].  Lecture at the Wiccan Conference in Canberra, 1991.</ref> and [[Thelema]], were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western [[occultism]].<ref>Jenkins, Phillip (2000) ''Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History'', pg. 74. \"Also in the 1880s, the tradition of ritual magic was revived in London by a group of Masonic adepts, who formed the Order of the Golden Dawn, which would prove an incalculable influence on the whole subsequent history of occultism.\" USA: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Smoley, Richard (1999) ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'', ppg 102-103. \"Founded in 1888, the Golden Dawn lasted a mere twelve years before it was shattered by personal conflicts. At its height it probably had no more than a hundred members. Yet its influence on magic and esoteric thought in the English-speaking world would be hard to overestimate.\" USA: Quest Books.</ref>  The three founders, [[William Robert Woodman]], [[William Wynn Westcott]], and [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], were [[Freemasons]] and members of [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] (S.R.I.A.).<ref>Regardie, 1993, page 10</ref>   Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn.  The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the [[Masonic Lodge]]s; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men.  The \"Golden Dawn\" was the first of three Orders, although all three are often collectively referred to as the \"Golden Dawn\".  The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the [[Hermetic Qabalah]] and personal development through study and awareness of the [[Classical Elements|four Classical Elements]] as well as the basics of [[astrology]], [[tarot divination]], and [[geomancy]].  The Second or \"Inner\" Order, the ''Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis'' (the Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold), taught proper magic, including [[scrying]], [[Astral projection|astral travel]], and [[alchemy]].  The Third Order was that of the \"[[Secret Chiefs]]\", who were said to be highly skilled; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order.  ==Influences== {{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}} Influences on Golden Dawn concepts and work include:  [[Christian mysticism]], [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalah]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], [[Theurgy]], [[Freemasonry]], [[Alchemy]], [[Theosophy]], Astrology, [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Papus]], John Dee & Edward Kelly, [[Enochian magic]], and [[Renaissance]] [[grimoire]]s, as well as [[Anna Kingsford]] & [[Frederick Hockley]].  ==History==  ===Cipher Manuscripts=== {{Main|Cipher Manuscripts}} [[File:Folio 13.png|thumb|right|Folio 13 of the [[Cipher Manuscripts]]]]  The foundational documents of the original Order of the Golden Dawn, known as the [[Cipher Manuscripts]], are written in English using [[Trithemius cipher]].  The manuscripts give the specific outlines of the Grade Rituals of the Order and prescribe a curriculum of graduated teachings that encompass the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], [[astrology]], [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|occult tarot]], [[geomancy]], and [[alchemy]].  According to the records of the Order, the manuscripts passed from [[Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie]], a Masonic scholar, to the Rev. [[A. F. A. Woodford]], whom British occult writer [[Francis X. King|Francis King]] describes as the fourth founder<ref name=\"ref\"> King, 1989, page 42-43</ref> (although Woodford died shortly after the Order was founded).<ref name=\"yoga\">King, 1989, page 47</ref>  The documents did not excite Woodford, and in February 1886 he passed them on to Freemason [[William Wynn Westcott]], who managed to decode them in 1887.<ref name=\"ref\"/> Westcott, pleased with his discovery, called on fellow Freemason [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]]  for a second opinion. Westcott asked for Mathers' help to turn the manuscripts into a coherent system for lodge work. Mathers in turn asked fellow Freemason [[William Robert Woodman]] to assist the two, and he accepted.<ref name=\"ref\"/> Mathers and Westcott have been credited with developing the ritual outlines in the Cipher Manuscripts into a workable format.<ref> Golden Dawn researcher R. A. Gilbert has found evidence which suggests that Westcott was instrumental in developing the Order's rituals from the Cipher Manuscripts. See Gilbert's article, ''From Cipher to Enigma: The Role of William Wynn Westcott in the Creation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn'', from Carroll Runyon's book ''Secrets of the Golden Dawn Cypher Manuscripts.'' </ref> Mathers, however, is generally credited with the design of the curriculum and rituals of the Second Order, which he called the ''Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis'' (\"Ruby Rose and Golden Cross\" or the ''RR et AC'').<ref>Regardie, 1993, page 92</ref>  [[File:Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers in Egyptian getup.jpg|thumbnail|Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers in Egyptian setup performing a ritual in hermetic order of the Golden Dawn.]]  ===Founding of first temple=== In October 1887, Westcott claimed to have written to a German countess and prominent Rosicrucian named [[Anna Sprengel]], whose address was said to have been found in the decoded Cipher Manuscripts. According to Westcott, Sprengel claimed the ability to contact certain supernatural entities, known as the [[Secret Chiefs]], that were considered the authorities over any magical order or esoteric organization. Westcott purportedly received a reply from Sprengel granting permission to establish a Golden Dawn temple and conferring honorary grades of [[Adept|Adeptus Exemptus]] on Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman.  The temple was to consist of the five grades outlined in the manuscripts.<ref name=\"king\">King, 1989, page 43</ref><ref name=\"regard\">Regardie, 1993, page 11.</ref>  In 1888, the [[Isis-Urania Temple]] was founded in [[London]].<ref name=\"king\"/>  In contrast to the S.R.I.A. and Masonry,<ref name=\"regard\"/> women were allowed and welcome to participate in the Order in \"perfect equality\" with men. The Order was more of a philosophical and metaphysical teaching order in its early years.  Other than certain rituals and meditations found in the Cipher manuscripts and developed further,<ref>King, 1997, page 35</ref> \"magical practices\" were generally not taught at the first temple.  For the first four years, the Golden Dawn was one cohesive group later known as \"the Outer Order\" or \"First Order.\" An \"Inner Order\" was established and became active in 1892.  The Inner Order consisted of members known as \"adepts,\" who had completed the entire course of study for the Outer Order. This group of adepts eventually became known as the Second Order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Eventually, the Osiris temple in [[Weston-super-Mare]], the Horus temple in [[Bradford]] (both in 1888), and the Amen-Ra temple in [[Edinburgh]] (1893) were founded. In 1893 Mathers founded the Ahathoor temple in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"king\"/>  ===Secret Chiefs=== {{Main|Secret Chiefs}} In 1891, Westcott's alleged correspondence with Anna Sprengel suddenly ceased.  He claimed to have received word from Germany that she was either dead or that her companions did not approve of the founding of the Order and no further contact was to be made. If the founders were to contact the [[Secret Chiefs]], apparently, it had to be done on their own.<ref name=\"king\" /> In 1892, Mathers professed that a link to the Secret Chiefs had been established.  Subsequently, he supplied rituals for the Second Order, calling them the Red Rose and Cross of Gold.<ref name=\"king\"/> The rituals were based on the tradition of the tomb of [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], and a ''Vault of Adepts'' became the controlling force behind the Outer Order.<ref>King, 1989, page 44</ref> Later in 1916, Westcott claimed that Mathers also constructed these rituals from materials he received from Frater Lux ex Tenebris, a purported ''Continental Adept''.<ref>King, 1989, page 46</ref>  Some followers{{Who|date=August 2009}} of the Golden Dawn tradition believe that the Secret Chiefs were not human or supernatural beings but, rather, symbolic representations of actual or legendary sources of spiritual esotericism.  The term came to stand for a great leader or teacher of a spiritual path or practice that found its way into the teachings of the Order.<ref>Penczak, Christopher. ''Spirit Allies'', p. 27.  Red Wheel/Weiser Books. ISBN 1-57863-214-5</ref>  ===Golden Age=== By the mid-1890s, the Golden Dawn was well established in Great Britain, with over one hundred members from every class of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society.<ref name=\"yoga\"/> Many celebrities belonged to the Golden Dawn, such as the actress [[Florence Farr]], the Irish revolutionary [[Maud Gonne]], the Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]], the Welsh author [[Arthur Machen]], and the English authors [[Evelyn Underhill]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].  In 1896 or 1897, Westcott broke all ties to the Golden Dawn, leaving Mathers in control. It has been speculated that his departure was due to his having lost a number of occult-related papers in a [[hansom cab]].  Apparently, when the papers were found, Westcott's connection to the Golden Dawn was discovered and brought to the attention of his employers. He may have been told to either resign from the Order or to give up his occupation as [[coroner]].<ref>King, 1989, page 48</ref> After Westcott's departure, Mathers appointed Florence Farr to be Chief Adept in Anglia.  Dr. [[Henry B. Pullen Burry]] succeeded Westcott as Cancellarius—one of the three Chiefs of the Order.  Mathers was the only active founding member after Westcott's departure. Due to personality clashes with other members and frequent absences from the center of Lodge activity in Great Britain, however, challenges to Mathers's authority as leader developed among the members of the Second Order.<ref>{{cite book| last = [[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]] | editor = Liam Miller| title = Yeats, the Tarot and the Golden Dawn| edition = second| series = New Yeats Papers| volume = II| origyear = 1972| year = 1976| publisher = Dolmen Press| location = Dublin| page = 6}}</ref>  ===Revolt=== Toward the end of 1899, the Adepts of the Isis-Urania and Amen-Ra temples had become dissatisfied with Mathers' leadership, as well as his growing friendship with [[Aleister Crowley]]. They had also become anxious to make contact with the Secret Chiefs themselves, instead of relying on Mathers as an intermediary.<ref name=\"meatloaf\">King, 1989, page 66</ref> Within the Isis-Urania temple, disputes were arising between Farr's ''The Sphere'', a secret society within the Isis-Urania, and the rest of the Adepti Minores.<ref name=\"meatloaf\"/>  Crowley was refused initiation into the Adeptus Minor grade by the London officials. Mathers overrode their decision and quickly initiated him at the Ahathoor temple in Paris on January 16, 1900.<ref name=\"farr\">King, 1989, page 67</ref> Upon his return to the London temple, Crowley requested from Miss Cracknell, the acting secretary, the papers acknowledging his grade, to which he was now entitled. To the London Adepts, this was the final straw. Farr, already of the opinion that the London temple should be closed, wrote to Mathers expressing her wish to resign as his representative, although she was willing to carry on until a successor was found.<ref name=\"farr\"/> Mathers believed  Westcott was behind this turn of events and replied on February 16. On March 3, a committee of seven Adepts was elected in London, and requested a full investigation of the matter. Mathers sent an immediate reply, declining to provide proof, refusing to acknowledge the London temple, and dismissing Farr as his representative on March 23.<ref>King, 1989, page 68-69</ref> In response, a general meeting was called on March 29 in London to remove Mathers as chief and expel him from the Order.<ref>King, 1989, page 69</ref>  ====Splinters==== In 1901, W. B. Yeats privately published a pamphlet titled ''Is the Order of R. R. & A. C. to Remain a Magical Order?''<ref>Melton, J. Gordon, editor, ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', v. 2 p. 1327, Gale Group, 2001 ISBN 0-8103-9489-8</ref> After the Isis-Urania temple claimed its independence, there were even more disputes, leading to Yeats resigning.<ref>King, 1989, page 78</ref> A committee of three was to temporarily govern, which included P.W. Bullock, M.W. Blackden and [[J. W. Brodie-Innes]]. After a short time, Bullock resigned, and Dr. [[Robert Felkin]] took his place.<ref>King, 1989, page 94</ref>  In 1903, [[Arthur Edward Waite|A.E. Waite]] and Blackden joined forces to retain the name Isis-Urania, while Felkin and other London members formed the [[Stella Matutina]].  Yeats remained in the Stella Matutina until 1921, while Brodie-Innes continued his Amen-Ra membership in Edinburgh.<ref>King, 1989, pages 95-96</ref>  ===Reconstruction=== Once Mathers realised that reconciliation was impossible, he made efforts to reestablish himself in London. The Bradford and Weston-super-Mare temples remained loyal to him, but their numbers were few.<ref>King, 1989, page 109</ref> He then appointed [[Edmund William Berridge|Edward Berridge]] as his representative.<ref name=\"coffee\">King, 1989, page 110</ref> According to Francis King, historical evidence shows that there were \"twenty three members of a flourishing Second Order under Berridge-Mathers in 1913.\"<ref name=\"coffee\"/>  J.W. Brodie-Innes continued leading the Amen-Ra temple, deciding that the revolt was unjustified. By 1908, Mathers and Brodie-Innes were in complete accord.<ref name=\"serpent\">Regardie, 1993, page 33</ref> According to sources that differ regarding the actual date, sometime between 1901 and 1913 Mathers renamed the branch of the Golden Dawn remaining loyal to his leadership to [[Alpha et Omega]].<ref>King, 1971, p. 110-111</ref><ref name=\"donouts\">King, 1989, page 111</ref><ref name=\"freemason-bio\">\"The Golden Dawn ceased to exist by that name after October, 1901, replaced by Mathers' Alpha et Omega and the London group’s Order of the Morgan Rothe.

Most temples of the Alpha et Omega and Stella Matutina closed or went into abeyance by the end of the 1930s, with the exceptions of two Stella Matutina temples: Hermes Temple in [[Bristol]], which operated sporadically until 1970, and the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple (commonly referred to as  [[Whare Ra]]) in [[Havelock North]], [[New Zealand]], which operated regularly until its closure in 1978.<ref name=Companion>Gilbert, R.

The Neophyte Grade of \"0=0\" indicates no position on the Tree. In the other pairs, the first numeral is the number of steps up from the bottom (Malkuth), and the second numeral is the number of steps down from the top (Kether).  The First Order Grades were related to the [[Classical elements|four elements]] of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, respectively.  The Aspirant to a Grade received instruction on the metaphysical meaning of each of these Elements and had to pass a written examination and demonstrate certain skills to receive admission to that Grade.  The Portal Grade was an \"Invisible\" or in-between grade separating the First Order from the Second Order.<ref>[http://www.golden-dawn.org/wgd.html Golden Dawn Research Center - What is the Golden Dawn?]</ref> The Circle of existing Adepts from the Second Order had to consent to allow an Aspirant to be initiated as an Adept and join the Second Order.  The Second Order was not, properly, part of the \"Golden Dawn\", but a separate Order in its own right, known as the R.R. et A.C. The Second Order directed the teachings of the First Order and was the governing force behind the First Order.  After passing the Portal, the Aspirant was instructed in the techniques of practical magic. When another examination was passed, and the other Adepts consented, the Aspirant attained the Grade of Adeptus Minor (5=6). There were also four sub-Grades of instruction for the Adeptus Minor, again relating to the four Outer Order grades.  A member of the Second Order had the power and authority to initiate aspirants to the First Order, though usually not without the permission of the Chiefs of his or her Lodge.  ==''The Golden Dawn'' book== The encyclopedic text ''The Golden Dawn'', by Israel Regardie, has been the most intensively used source for modern western occult and magical practice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}<ref>Weschcke, Carl L., Publisher, ''Publishers Preface'' (1982) The Golden Dawn</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2014}}  ==Known or alleged members==  *[[Damien Echols]] (1985–Present), One of the West Memphis Three <ref>https://soundcloud.com/transgression-podcast/006-damien-echols</ref> *[[Sara Allgood]] (1879–1950), Irish stage actress and later film actress in America *[[Charles Henry Allan Bennett]] (1872–1923), best known for introducing [[Buddhism]] to the West *[[Arnold Bennett]] (1867–1931), British novelist<ref>Regardie, 1982, page 16</ref> *[[Edmund William Berridge|Edward W.

In its modern most practised format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. At the elite level, athletes run towards the bar and use the [[Fosbury Flop]] method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar. Performed since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly more effective techniques to arrive at the current form.  The discipline is, alongside the [[pole vault]], one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]]. It is contested at the [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]].  [[Javier Sotomayor]] ([[Cuba]]) is the current men's record holder with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|2.45}} set in 1993 – the longest standing record in the history of the men's high jump. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] ([[Bulgaria]]) has held the women's world record at {{T&Fcalc|2.09}} since 1987, also the longest-held record in the event.  ==Rules== [[File:Nicole Forrester.JPG|thumb|Canadian high jumper [[Nicole Forrester]] demonstrating the Fosbury flop]] Jumpers must take off on one foot.  The rules for the high jump are set internationally by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). A jump is considered a failure if the bar is dislodged by the action of the jumper whilst jumping or the jumper touches the ground or breaks the plane of the near edge of the bar before clearance. The technique one uses for the jump must be almost flawless in order to have a chance of clearing a high bar.  Competitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.  The victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final. If two or more jumpers tie for first place, the tie-breakers are: 1) The fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) The fewest misses throughout the competition.  If the event remains tied for first place (or a limited advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next greater height. Each jumper has one attempt. The bar is then alternately lowered and raised until only one jumper succeeds at a given height.<ref name=\"rules\">[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf] iaaf rules</ref>  ==History== [[File:1912 Konstantinos Tsiklitiras2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Konstantinos Tsiklitiras]] during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]] The first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a [[Scissors-Jump|scissors]] technique. In the later years, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to modernise, starting with the Irish-American [[Michael Sweeney (athlete)|Michael Sweeney's]] ''[[Eastern cut-off]]''. By taking off like the scissors, but extending his back and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney achieved a more economic clearance and raised the world record to {{T&Fcalc|1.97}} in 1895.  Another American, [[George Horine]], developed an even more efficient technique, the ''[[Western roll]]''. In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to {{T&Fcalc|2.01}} in 1912. His technique was predominant through the [[Berlin Olympics]] of 1936, in which the event was won by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] at {{T&Fcalc|2.03}}.  American and Soviet jumpers held the playing field for the next four decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the [[straddle technique]]. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most economical clearance up to that time. Straddle-jumper [[Charles Dumas]] was the first to clear 7 feet (2.13&nbsp;m) in 1956, and American [[John Thomas (high jumper)|John Thomas]] pushed the world mark to {{T&Fcalc|2.23}} in 1960. [[Valeriy Brumel]] took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to {{T&Fcalc|2.28}}, and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career. [[File:EthelCatherwood1928.jpg|thumb|Gold medal winner [[Ethel Catherwood]] of Canada ''scissors'' over the bar at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. Her winning result was {{T&Fcalc|1.59}}.]]   [[File:1912 Platt Adams5.JPG|thumb|left|Platt Adams during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]] American coaches, including two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] champion Frank Costello of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at [[Oregon State University]], [[Dick Fosbury]], who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this [[Fosbury flop]] to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon ''floppers'' were dominating international high jump competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was [[Vladimir Yashchenko]], who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.33}} in 1977 and then {{T&Fcalc|2.35}} indoors in 1978.  Among renowned high jumpers following Fosbury's lead were Americans [[Dwight Stones]] and his rival, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|disp=flip}} tall [[Franklin Jacobs]] of Paterson, NJ, who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.32}},  {{convert|0.59|m}} over his head (a feat equaled 27 years later by Sweden's [[Stefan Holm]]); Chinese record-setters [[Ni Zhiqin|Ni-chi Chin]] and [[Zhu Jianhua]]; Germans [[Gerd Wessig]] and [[Dietmar Mögenburg]]; Swedish Olympic medalist and world record holder [[Patrik Sjöberg]]; and female jumpers [[Iolanda Balaş]] of Romania, [[Ulrike Meyfarth]] of Germany and Italy's [[Sara Simeoni]].  ==Technical aspects==  ===The approach=== [[File:Ruth Beitia Valence 2008.jpg|thumb|Spanish jumper [[Ruth Beitia]] approaching the bar from an angle]] The approach of the high jump may actually be more important than the take-off.  If a high jumper runs with bad timing or without enough aggression, clearing a high bar becomes more of a challenge.  The approach requires a certain shape or curve, the right amount of speed, and the correct number of strides.  The approach angle is also critical for optimal height.  Most great straddle jumpers have a run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees.  The length of the run is determined by the speed of the person's approach.  A slower run requires about 8 strides.  However, a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides.  A greater run speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward .<ref>[http://www.coachr.org/hj.htm Straddle Technique]</ref>  The '''J''' type approach, favored by Fosbury floppers, allows for horizontal speed, the ability to turn in the air (centripetal force), and good take-off position.  The approach should be a hard controlled stride so that a person does not fall from creating an angle with speed.  Athletes should run tall and lean on the curve, from the ankles and not the hips.<ref>[http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach]</ref>   ===The take-off===  Unlike the classic straddle technique, where the take-off foot is \"planted\" in the same spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their '''J''' approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.  An effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off.    Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach.  One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another.  Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row.<ref>[http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump]</ref> It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the '''J''' approach to carry the body across the bar.  == Winner declaration == In competition the winner is the person who cleared the highest height. In case of a tie, fewer failed attempts at that height are better: ''i.e.'', the jumper who makes a height on his or her first attempt is placed ahead of someone who clears the same height on the second or third attempt. If there still is a tie, all the failed attempts at lower heights are added up, and the one with the fewest total misses is declared the winner. If still tied, a playoff is held.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/jumps/high-jump \"How it works\".] iaaf.org. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Starting height is the next higher height after the overjumped one. If all the competitors clear the height, the bar is raised {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}, and if they fail, the bar is lowered 2&nbsp;cm. That continues until only one competitor succeeds in overjumping that height, and he or she is declared the winner.  * In the table below, dashes indicate that a height was not attempted, crosses indicate failed attempts, and circles indicate a cleared height. Jumpers '''A''' and '''D''' cleared 1.99&nbsp;m but failed at 2.01&nbsp;m. '''A''' wins this competition having cleared the winning height with two attempts, while jumper '''D''' required three attempts. Similarly, '''B''' is ranked ahead of '''C''', having cleared the decisive height (i.e., 1.97m) in the first attempt.  {|  class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" !style=\"align:center\"|Athlete||1.91&nbsp;m||1.93&nbsp;m||1.95&nbsp;m||1.97&nbsp;m||1.99&nbsp;m||2.01&nbsp;m||Height||Rank |- |align=\"center\"|A |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|XXX |align=\"center\"|1.99 |align=\"center\"|1st |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|XXX |align=\"center\"|  |align=\"center\"|1.97 |align=\"center\"|3rd |- |align=\"center\"|C |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|X-- |align=\"center\"|XX |align=\"center\"|1.97 |align=\"center\"|4th |- |align=\"center\"|D |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|XO |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|XXO |align=\"center\"|XXO |align=\"center\"|XXX |align=\"center\"|1.99 |align=\"center\"|2nd |- |align=\"center\"|E |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|O |align=\"center\"|- |align=\"center\"|XXX |align=\"center\"|  |align=\"center\"|  |align=\"center\"|&mdash; |align=\"center\"|5th |- |}  ==All-time top 25 athletes== {{see also|Men's high jump world record progression|Women's high jump world record progression|Men's high jump indoor world record progression}} *{{As of|September 2014}}.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/high-jump/outdoor/men/senior High Jump - men - senior - outdoor].

He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom. From the lonely life he led, and still more from the riddling<ref name=\"ix6\"/> and allegedly paradoxical<ref>[http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html William Harris — Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments]</ref> nature of his philosophy and his stress upon the needless unconsciousness of humankind,<ref>\"The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own\" ([[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] B89).</ref> he was called \"The Obscure\" and the \"Weeping Philosopher\".  Heraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever-present [[Change (philosophy)|change]] in the [[universe]], as stated in the famous saying, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\"<ref>This is how Plato puts Heraclitus' doctrine. See ''Cratylus'', 402a.</ref> (see [[#Panta rhei, \"everything flows\"|panta rhei]], below). This position was complemented by his stark commitment to a [[unity of opposites]] in the world, stating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that \"all entities come to be in accordance with this ''[[Logos]]''\" (literally, \"word\", \"reason\", or \"account\") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.  ==Life== [[File:Efez agora odeon prytaneion RB.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ephesus on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], birthplace of Heraclitus]] The main source for the life of Heraclitus is [[Diogenes Laërtius]], although some have questioned the validity of his account as \"''a tissue of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] anecdotes, most of them obviously fabricated on the basis of statements in the preserved fragments''.\"<ref name=\"kahn\">{{cite book | last=Kahn | first=Charles | title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus: Fragments with Translation and Commentary | location=London | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1979 | pages=1–23| isbn=0-521-28645-X}}</ref> Diogenes said that Heraclitus [[floruit|flourished]] in the 69th [[Olympiad]],<ref name=\"ix1\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 1</ref> 504–501 BCE. All the rest of the evidence — the people Heraclitus is said to have known, or the people who were familiar with his work — confirms the ''[[floruit]]''. His dates of birth and death are based on a life span of 60 years, the age at which Diogenes says he died,<ref name=\"ix3\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 3</ref> with the floruit in the middle.  Heraclitus was born to an aristocratic family in [[Ephesus]], Anatolia, in what is now called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn.<ref name=\"ix1\"/> Diogenes says that he [[abdication|abdicated]] the kingship (''basileia'') in favor of his brother<ref name=\"ix6\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 6</ref> and [[Strabo]] confirms that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges.<ref>Strabo, Chapter 1, section 3.</ref> How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus had been part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] since 547 and was ruled by a [[satrap]], a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play [[knucklebones]] with the youths in the temple of [[Artemis]] and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (''politeia'') was ''ponêra'',<ref name=\"ix2\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 2</ref> which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and [[Darius I]], quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.<ref>[[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] (2010), ''Heraclitus: The Cosmic Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, p. 1. ISBN 0521136679</ref>  With regard to education, Diogenes says that Heraclitus was \"wondrous\" (''thaumasios'', which, as Plato explains in the ''Theaetetus'' and elsewhere, is the beginning of philosophy) from childhood. Diogenes relates that [[Sotion]] said he was a \"hearer\" of [[Xenophanes]], which contradicts Heraclitus' statement (so says Diogenes) that he had taught himself by questioning himself. [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] states in any case that \"...&nbsp;Xenophanes left Ionia before Herakleitos was born.\"<ref>Chapter 3 beginning.</ref> Diogenes relates that as a boy Heraclitus had said he \"knew nothing\" but later claimed to \"know everything.\"<ref name=\"ix5\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 5</ref> His statement that he \"heard no one\" but \"questioned himself,\" can be placed alongside his statement that \"the things that can be seen, heard and learned are what I prize the most.\"<ref>DK B55.</ref>  Diogenes relates that Heraclitus had a poor opinion of human affairs.<ref name=\"ix1\"/> He believed that [[Hesiod]] and [[Pythagoras]] lacked understanding though learned<ref>DK B40.</ref> and that [[Homer]] and [[Archilochus]] deserved to be beaten.<ref>DK B42.</ref> Laws needed to be defended as though they were city walls.<ref>DK B44.</ref> [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]] is said to have called him a \"mob-reviler.\" Heraclitus hated the [[Athens|Athenians]] and his fellow Ephesians, wishing the latter wealth in punishment for their wicked ways.<ref>DK B125a.</ref> Says Diogenes: \"Finally, he became a hater of his kind (''misanthrope'') and wandered the mountains ... making his diet of grass and herbs.\"  Heraclitus' life as a philosopher was interrupted by [[edema|dropsy]]. The physicians he consulted were unable to prescribe a cure. He treated himself with a [[liniment]] of cow manure and baking in the sun, believing that this method would remove the fluid. After a day of treatment he died and was interred in the marketplace.<ref name=\"ix4\">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 4</ref>  ==Works== [[File:Raphael School of Athens Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Heraclitus (with the face and in the style of [[Michelangelo]]) sits apart from the other philosophers in [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]''.]] {{main|On Nature (Heraclitus)}} Diogenes states that Heraclitus' work was \"a continuous treatise ''On Nature'', but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology.\" [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes) \"...some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley.\"<ref name=\"ix6\"/>  Diogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BCE and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances; furthermore, many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work. Says [[Charles Kahn|Kahn]]:<ref name=\"kahn\"/> \"Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out.\" Diogenes says:<ref name=\"ix6\"/> \"the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called Heracliteans.\"  As with other pre-Socratics, his writings survive only in [[:s:Fragments of Heraclitus|fragments]] quoted by other authors.  ==Ancient characterizations==  ===\"The Obscure\"=== At some time in antiquity he acquired this epithet denoting that his major sayings were difficult to understand. According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]],<ref name=\"ix6\"/> [[Timon of Phlius]] called him \"the riddler\" ({{lang|grc|αἰνικτής}} ''ainiktēs''), and  explained that Heraclitus wrote his book \"rather unclearly\" (''asaphesteron'') so that only the \"capable\" should attempt it. By the time of [[Cicero]] he had become \"the dark\" ({{lang|grc|ὁ Σκοτεινός}} &mdash; {{lang|grc-Latn|''ho Skoteinós''}})<ref>''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'', Chapter 2, Section 15.</ref> because he had spoken ''nimis obscurē'', \"too obscurely\", concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood. The customary English translation of {{lang|grc|ὁ Σκοτεινός}} follows the Latin, \"the Obscure.\"  ===The \"weeping philosopher\"=== [[Image:Bust of Heraclitus, 'The Weeping Philosopher' LACMA M.83.4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bust of Heraclitus, 'The Weeping Philosopher' by [[Johann Christoph Ludwig Lücke]] ca. 1757.]] [[Diogenes Laërtius]] ascribes the theory that Heraclitus did not complete some of his works because of [[melancholia]] to [[Theophrastus]].<ref name=\"ix6\" /> Later he was referred to as the \"weeping philosopher,\" as opposed to [[Democritus]], who is known as the \"laughing philosopher.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Seneca | first=Lucius Annaeus | authorlink=Seneca the younger | coauthors=John M.

But although the ''Logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.

But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.<ref>DK B30.</ref></blockquote> This latter phraseology is further elucidated:<blockquote>All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.<ref>DK B90</ref></blockquote>  Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element. He believed fire gave rise to the other elements and thus to all things. He regarded the soul as being a mixture of fire and water, with fire being the noble part of the soul, and water the ignoble part. A soul should therefore aim toward becoming more full of fire and less full of water: a \"dry\" soul was best. According to Heraclitus, worldly pleasures made the soul \"moist\", and he considered mastering one's worldly desires to be a noble pursuit which purified the soul's fire.<ref name=\"russell\">[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]''</ref> [[Norman Melchert]] interpreted Heraclitus as using \"fire\" metaphorically, in lieu of ''Logos'', as the origin of all things.<ref>{{cite book |last=Melchert |first=Norman |year=2006 |title=The Great Conversation |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-530682-8}}</ref>  ===''Dike eris'',<!--nominative of \"diken erin\" (Β80)--> \"strife is justice\"=== If objects are new from moment to moment so that one can never touch the same object twice, then each object must dissolve and be generated continually momentarily and an object is a harmony between a building up and a tearing down. Heraclitus calls the oppositional processes ἔρις ''eris'', \"strife\", and hypothesizes that the apparently stable state, δίκη ''dikê'', or \"justice,\" is a harmony of it:<ref>DK B80: \"Εἰδέναι δὲ χρὴ τὸν πόλεμον ἐόντα ξυνὸν καὶ δίκην ἔριν, καὶ γινόμενα πάντα κατ' ἔριν καὶ χρεών\".</ref><blockquote>We must know that war (πόλεμος ''polemos'') is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being through strife necessarily.</blockquote> As Diogenes explains:<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 8</ref><blockquote>All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things (τὰ ὅλα ''ta hola'', \"the whole\") flows like a stream.</blockquote> In the bow [[metaphor]] Heraclitus compares the resultant to a strung bow held in shape by an equilibrium of the string tension and spring action of the bow:<ref>DK B51.</ref><blockquote>There is a harmony in the bending back (παλίντροπος ''palintropos'') as in the case of the bow and the lyre.</blockquote>  ===''Hepesthai to koino'', \"follow the common\"=== People must \"follow the common\" ({{lang|grc|ἕπεσθαι τῷ κοινῷ}} ''hepesthai tō koinō'')<ref>The initial part of DK B2, often omitted because broken by a note explaining that ξυνός ''ksunos'' (Ionic) is κοινός ''koinos'' (Attic).</ref> and not live having \"their own judgement (''phronēsis'')\". He distinguishes between human laws and divine law (τοῦ θείου ''tou theiou'' \"of God\").<ref>DK B114.</ref> By \"God\" Heraclitus does not mean the Judeo-Christian version of a single God as primum mobile of all things, God as Creator, but the divine as opposed the human, the immortal (which we tend to confuse with  the \"eternal\") as opposed to the mortal, the cyclical as opposed to the transient. It is more accurate to speak of \"the god\" and not of \"God\".  He removes the human sense of justice from his concept of God; i.e., humanity is not the image of God: \"To God all things are fair and good and just, but people hold some things wrong and some right.\"<ref>DK B102.</ref> God's custom has wisdom but human custom does not,<ref>DK B78.</ref> and yet both humans and God are childish (inexperienced): \"human opinions are children's toys\"<ref>DK B70.</ref> and \"Eternity is a child moving counters in a game; the kingly power is a child's.\"<ref>DK B52.</ref>  Wisdom is \"to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things\",<ref>DK B41.</ref> which must not imply that people are or can be wise. Only [[Zeus]] is wise.<ref>DK B32.</ref> To some degree then Heraclitus seems to be in the [[Mysticism|mystic's]] position of urging people to follow God's plan without much of an idea what that may be. In fact there is a note of despair: \"The [[best of all possible worlds|fairest universe]] ({{lang|grc|κάλλιστος κόσμος}} ''kallistos [[Cosmos|kosmos]]'') is but a heap of rubbish ({{lang|grc|σάρμα}} ''sarma'', sweepings) piled up (κεχυμένον ''kechumenon'', i.e. \"poured out\") at random ({{lang|grc|εἰκῇ}} ''eikê'', \"aimlessly\").\"<ref>DK B124.</ref>  ===''Ethos anthropoi daimon'', \"character is fate\"=== This influential quote by Heraclitus \"ἦθος ἀνθρώπῳ δαίμων\" (DK 22B119) has led to numerous interpretations. Whether in this context, \"daimon\" can indeed be translated to mean \"fate\" is disputed, however, it lends much sense to Heraclitus' observations and conclusions about human nature in general. While the translation with \"fate\" is generally accepted as in Kahn's \"a man's character is his divinity\", in some cases, it may also stand for the soul of the departed.<ref>Thomas L.

He typically uses the ordinary word \"to become\" (''gignesthai'' or ''ginesthai'', root sense of being born), which led to his being characterized as the philosopher of becoming rather than of being. He recognizes the fundamental changing of objects with the flow of time.  [[Plato]] argues against Heraclitus as follows:<ref>[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] Paragraph 440 sections c-d.</ref><blockquote>How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state? ... for at the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other ... so that you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state .... but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever ... then I do not think they can resemble a process or flux ....</blockquote>  In Plato one experienced unit is a state, or object existing, which can be observed. The time parameter is set at \"ever\"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations, but no matter how many of those you are able to make, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there.  ===Stoics=== [[Stoicism]] was a philosophical school which flourished between the 3rd century BCE and about the 3rd century CE. It began among the Greeks and became the major philosophy of the [[Roman Empire]] before declining with the rise of [[Christianity]] in the 3rd century.  Throughout their long tenure the Stoics believed that the major tenets of their philosophy derived from the thought of Heraclitus.<ref>{{cite book | first=A.A. | last=Long | title=Stoic Studies | publisher=University of California Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-520-22974-6 | pages=Chapter 2 | nopp=true}}</ref> According to [[A. A. Long|Long]], \"the importance of Heraclitus to later Stoics is evident most plainly in [[Marcus Aurelius]].\"<ref>Long (2001), p. 56.</ref> Explicit connections of the earliest Stoics to Heraclitus showing how they arrived at their interpretation are missing but they can be inferred from the Stoic fragments, which Long concludes are \"modifications of Heraclitus.\"<ref>Long (2001), p. 51.</ref>  The Stoics were interested in Heraclitus' treatment of fire. In addition to seeing it as the most fundamental of the four elements and the one that is quantified and determines the quantity (''logos'') of the other three, he presents fire as the cosmos, which was not made by any of the gods or men, but \"was and is and ever shall be ever-living fire.\"<ref>DK B60.</ref> Fire is both a substance and a motivator of change, it is active in altering other things quantitatively and performing an activity Heraclitus describes as \"the judging and convicting of all things.\"<ref>DK B66.</ref> It is \"the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\"<ref>DK B64.</ref> There is no reason to interpret the judgement, which is actually \"to separate\" (κρίνειν ''krinein''), as outside of the context of \"strife is justice\" (see subsection above).

[[Zeus]] rules the universe with law (''nomos'') wielding on its behalf the \"forked servant\", the \"fire\" of the \"ever-living lightning.\" So far nothing has been said that differs from the Zeus of [[Homer]]. But then, says Cleanthes, Zeus uses the fire to \"straighten out the common logos\" that travels about (''phoitan'', \"to frequent\") mixing with the greater and lesser lights (heavenly bodies). This is Heraclitus' logos, but now it is confused with the \"common ''nomos''\", which Zeus uses to \"make the wrong (''perissa'', left or odd) right (''artia'', right or even)\" and \"order (''kosmein'') the disordered (''akosma'').\"<ref>The ancient Greek can be found in {{cite book | first=E.H. | last=Blakeney | author-link=Edward Henry Blakeney | title=The Hymn of Cleanthes: Greek Text Translated into English: with Brief Introduction and Notes | location=New York | publisher=The MacMillan Company }} Downloadable Google Books at [http://books.google.com/books?id=C-gqSkvGz-kC&pg=PA2&dq=Hymn+to+Zeus+Cleanthes&as_brr=3&ei=nQ9QR6fdNIuEpgK-o4DyDQ#PPA1,M1].</ref>  The Stoic modification of Heraclitus' idea of the Logos was also influential on [[Judaism|Jewish]] philosophers such as [[Philo]] of Alexandria, who connected it to \"Wisdom personified\" <!--{Sophia?} --> as God's creative principle. Philo uses the term Logos throughout his treatises on Hebrew Scripture in a manner clearly influenced by the Stoics.  ===Church fathers=== [[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Democritus|Democriet]] (laughing) & Herakliet (crying) by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]]]] The [[church fathers]] were the leaders of the early [[Christian Church]] during its first five centuries of existence, roughly contemporaneous to Stoicism under the [[Roman Empire]]. The works of dozens of writers in hundreds of pages have survived.  All of them had something to say about the Christian form of the [[Logos]]. The Catholic Church found it necessary to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other [[Pre-Socratics]] (and [[Platonic Academy|Academics]]) as sources of [[heresy]]. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.  In ''Refutation of All Heresies''<ref>Book IX leading sentence.</ref> Hippolytus says: \"What the blasphemous folly is of [[Noetus]], and that he devoted himself to the tenets of Heraclitus the Obscure, not to those of Christ.\" Hippolytus then goes on to present the inscrutable DK B67: \"God (''theos'') is day and night, winter and summer, ... but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.\" The fragment seems to support [[pantheism]] if taken literally. German physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernard Weinstein]] classed these views with [[pandeism]].<ref name=\"Weinstein-Greece\">Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\") (1910), p. 233: \"Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet. Daß Gott als feurig gedacht wird (jedoch auch als Atem oder Äther) ist dem Menschen entnommen, dessen Wärme sein Lebensprinzip bedeutet; eine Idee, die sich schon bei den ersten griechischen Philosophen und namentlich bei Heraklit findet.\"</ref>  Hippolytus condemns the obscurity of it. He cannot accuse Heraclitus of being a heretic so he says instead: \"Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate Noetus in framing a system ...?\" The apparent pantheist deity of Heraclitus (if that is what DK B67 means) must be equal to the union of opposites and therefore must be corporeal and incorporeal, divine and not-divine, dead and alive, etc., and the [[Trinity]] can only be reached by some sort of illusory shape-shifting.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hippolytus | title=Refutation of All Heresies | pages=Book IX Chapter 5 | publisher=New Advent | url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050109.htm | accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>  The Apologist Justin Martyr, however, took a much more positive view of him. In his First Apology, he said both Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians before Christ: \"those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them.\" <ref>{{cite web | author=Justin Martyr | title =First Apology of Justin | publisher=Early Christian Writings | url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html}}</ref>  ==See also== The following articles on other topics contain non-trivial information that relates to Heraclitus in some way. {{col-begin}} {{col-2}} * [[Becoming (philosophy)]] * [[Cratylus]] * [[Dialectical monism]] * [[Dialectics]] * [[Dualism]] * [[Ephesian School]] * {{el icon}} [[:s:el:Αποσπάσματα (Ηράκλειτος)|Quotes of Heraclitus (Apospásmata)]] *[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Heraclitus|Heraclitus' influence on Hegel]] * [[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]] * [[Ionian School (philosophy)]] * [[Logos]] {{col-2}} * [[Marcel Conche]] * [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)]] * [[Nondualism]] * [[Pandeism]] * [[Pantheism]] * [[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]] * [[Philosophy of space and time]] * [[Process philosophy]] * [[Unity of opposites]] * [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] {{col-end}}  ==Notes== {{reflist|2}}  ==Further reading==  ===Editions and translations=== * Botten, Mick.

In December 1972, as one of the crew on board [[Apollo 17]], Schmitt became the first member of [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|NASA's first scientist-astronaut group]] to fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions, he also became the twelfth [[List of Apollo astronauts#People who have walked on the Moon|person to set foot on the Moon]], and {{as of|2015|lc=true}}, the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] shortly before commander [[Eugene Cernan]]).

Schmitt resigned from NASA in August 1975 in order to run for election to the [[United States Senate]] as a member from New Mexico. As the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate in [[United States Senate election in New Mexico, 1976|the 1976 election]], he defeated the two-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] incumbent [[Joseph Montoya]], but, running for re-election [[United States Senate election in New Mexico, 1982|in 1982]], was himself defeated, by Democrat [[Jeff Bingaman]].  ==Biography==  === Early life and education === Born in [[Santa Rita, New Mexico]], Schmitt grew up in nearby [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]],<ref name=\"CIT\">{{cite web  |title       = 50 Years in Space - Harrison Schmitt  |url         = http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/space50/program/speakers/SchmittH.html  |archiveurl  = http://www.webcitation.org/5hYlJ5AiC  |publisher   = California Institute of Technology  |archivedate = June 16, 2009  |accessdate  = June 16, 2009 }}</ref> and he is a graduate of the [[Western High School (Silver City, New Mexico)|Western High School]] (class of 1953).

Following his selection, Schmitt spent his first year at [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] [[Undergraduate Pilot Training|UPT]] learning to become a jet pilot. Upon his return to the astronaut corps in Houston, he played a key role in training Apollo crews to be [[geologic]] observers when they were in lunar orbit and competent geologic field workers when they were on the lunar surface. After each of the landing missions, he participated in the examination and evaluation of the returned lunar samples and helped the crews with the scientific aspects of their mission reports.  Schmitt spent considerable time becoming proficient in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] systems.  In March 1970 he became the first of the scientist-astronauts to be assigned to space flight, joining [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.]] (Commander) and [[Vance Brand]] (Command Module Pilot) on the [[Apollo 15]] backup crew. The flight rotation put these three in line to fly as prime crew on the third following mission, Apollo 18. When [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo flights 18 and 19 were cancelled]] in September 1970, the community of lunar [[geologist]]s supporting Apollo felt so strongly about the need to land a professional geologist on the Moon, that they pressured [[NASA]] to reassign Schmitt to a remaining flight. As a result, Schmitt was assigned in August 1971 to fly on the last mission, [[Apollo 17]], replacing [[Joe Engle]] as Lunar Module Pilot. Schmitt landed on the Moon with commander [[Gene Cernan]] in December 1972.<ref name=a17pre>{{cite web|title=A Running Start – Apollo 17 up to Powered Descent Initiation|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>  Schmitt claims to have taken the photograph of the [[Earth]] known as ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence. (NASA officially credits the image to the entire Apollo 17 crew.)  While on the Moon's surface, Schmitt&nbsp;— the only geologist in the astronaut corps&nbsp;— collected the rock sample designated [[Troctolite 76535]], which has been called \"without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon\".<ref>[http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/compendium.cfm Lunar Sample Compendium at jsc.nasa.gov]</ref>  Among other distinctions, it is the central piece of evidence suggesting that the Moon once possessed an active magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/science/space/20moon.html \"Rock Suggests Early Moon's Fiery Core Churned a Magnetic Field\", The New York Times, January 19, 2009]</ref>  As he returned to the Lunar Module before Cernan, Schmitt is the next-to-last person to have walked on the Moon's surface.  After the completion of Apollo 17, Schmitt played an active role in documenting the Apollo geologic results and also took on the task of organizing NASA's Energy Program Office.  <gallery> File:Astronaut Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt, American Flag, and Earth (Apollo 17 EVA-1).jpg|Schmitt poses by the [[Lunar Flag Assembly|American flag]], with [[Earth]] in the background, during ''[[Apollo 17]]'s'' first [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]].

He served one term and, notably, was the ranking Republican member of the [[Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee]]. He sought a second term in the [[United States Senate election in New Mexico, 1982|1982]], but due to a deep recession and concerns that he wasn't paying attention to local matters, he was defeated in a re-election bid by the state Attorney General [[Jeff Bingaman]] by a 54% to 46% margin.

Besides Germany, they also ruled the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1194–1268). In Italian historiography, they are known as the ''Svevi'' (Swabians), since they were [[Duke of Swabia]] from 1079. Three members of the dynasty—[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]—were crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  ==Name== [[File:Hohenstaufen Castle Ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Hohenstaufen castle]] The name \"Hohenstaufen\", meaning \"high Staufen\", originates in the 14th century, when it was first used to distinguish the [[conical hill]] named [[Hohenstaufen (mountain)|Staufen]] in the [[Swabian Jura]], in the district of [[Göppingen (district)|Göppingen]], from the village of the same name in the valley below. The name \"Staufen\" derives from ''Stauf'' (formerly ''stouf''), meaning \"chalice\", and was commonly applied to conical hills in Swabia in the Middle Ages. The family derives its name from the castle which the first Swabian duke of the lineage built there in the latter half of the 11th century. [[Hohenstaufen Castle|Staufen castle]] was only finally called Hohenstaufen by historians in the 19th century, to distinguish it from other castles of the same name. The name of the dynasty followed, but in recent decades the trend in German historiography has been to prefer the name Staufer.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Federico II: Enciclopedia fridericiana |title=Hohenstaufen, famiglia |first=Hansmartin |last=Schwarzmaier |year=2005 |location=Rome |publisher=Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana |postscript=. Translated by Maria Paola Arena |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/famiglia-hohenstaufen_%28Federiciana%29/}}</ref>  ==Origins== In 1079, the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Germany]] appointed Count Frederick I at Hohenstaufen Castle as [[Duke of Swabia]].  At the same time, Frederick was engaged to the king's approximately seventeen-year-old daughter, [[Agnes of Germany|Agnes]].  Nothing is known about Frederick's life before this event, but he proved to be an imperial ally throughout Henry's struggles against other Swabian lords, namely [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], Frederick's predecessor, and the [[House of Zähringen|Zähringen]] and [[House of Welf|Welf]] lords.  Frederick's brother Otto was elevated to the [[bishop of Strasbourg|Strasbourg bishopric]] in 1082.  Upon Frederick's death, he was succeeded by his son, Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Frederick II]], in 1105.  Frederick II remained a close ally of the Salians, he and his younger brother [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad]] were named the king's representatives in Germany when the king was in Italy.  Around 1120, Frederick II married Judith of Bavaria from the rival [[House of Welf]].  ==Ruling in Germany== When the last male member of the Salian dynasty, Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], died without heirs in 1125, a controversy arose about the succession. Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Frederick II]] and [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad]], the two current male Staufers, by their mother Agnes were grandsons of late Emperor Henry IV and nephews of Henry V. Frederick attempted to succeed to the throne of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (formally known as the [[King of the Romans]]) through a customary election, but lost to the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] duke [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]]. A civil war between Frederick's dynasty and Lothair's ended with Frederick's submission in 1134. After Lothair's death in 1137, Frederick's brother Conrad was elected King as Conrad III.  Because the [[House of Welf|Welf duke]] [[Henry the Proud]], son-in-law and heir of Lothair and the most powerful prince in Germany, who had been passed over in the election, refused to acknowledge the new king, Conrad III deprived him of all his territories, giving the [[Duchy of Saxony]] to [[Albert the Bear]] and that of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to [[Leopold&nbsp;IV, Margrave of Austria]]. In 1147, Conrad heard [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] preach the [[Second Crusade]] at [[Speyer]], and he agreed to join King [[Louis VII of France]] in a great [[Second Crusade|expedition]] to the [[Holy Land]] which failed.  Conrad's brother Duke Frederick II died in 1147, and was succeeded in Swabia by his son, Duke [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. When King Conrad III died without adult heir in 1152, Frederick also succeeded him, taking both German royal and Imperial titles.  ===Frederick Barbarossa=== Frederick I, known as Frederick Barbarossa because of his red beard, struggled throughout his reign to restore the power and prestige of the German monarchy against the dukes, whose power had grown both before and after the [[Investiture Controversy]] under his Salian predecessors.  As royal access to the resources of the church in Germany was much reduced, Frederick was forced to go to [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]] to find the finances needed to restore the king's power in Germany. He was soon crowned emperor in Italy, but decades of warfare on the peninsula yielded scant results. The [[Papal States|Papacy]] and the prosperous city-states of the [[Lombard League]] in northern Italy were traditional enemies, but the fear of Imperial domination caused them to join ranks to fight Frederick. Under the skilled leadership of [[Pope Alexander III]], the alliance suffered many defeats but ultimately was able to deny the emperor a complete victory in Italy. Frederick returned to Germany. He had vanquished one notable opponent, his Welf cousin, Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of Saxony and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in 1180, but his hopes of restoring the power and prestige of the monarchy seemed unlikely to be met by the end of his life.  During Frederick's long stays in Italy, the German princes became stronger and began a successful colonization of Slavic lands. Offers of reduced taxes and manorial duties enticed many Germans to settle in the east in the course of the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''. In 1163 Frederick waged a successful campaign against the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in order to re-install the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] dukes of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dynasty. With the German colonization, the Empire increased in size and came to include the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] as well as [[Bohemia]] and the [[March of Moravia]]. A quickening economic life in Germany increased the number of towns and [[Free imperial city|Imperial cities]], and gave them greater importance. It was also during this period that castles and courts replaced monasteries as centers of culture. Growing out of this courtly culture, [[Middle High German]] literature reached its peak in lyrical love poetry, the [[Minnesang]], and in narrative epic poems such as ''[[Tristan]]'', ''[[Parzival]]'', and the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. [[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his sons King Henry VI and Duke [[Frederick V, Duke of Swabia|Frederick V of Swabia]], ''Welfenchronik'', 1167/79, [[Weingarten Abbey]]]]  ===Henry VI=== Frederick died in 1190 while on the [[Third Crusade]] and was succeeded by his son, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. Elected king even before his father's death, Henry went to [[Rome]] to be crowned emperor. He married Queen [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Sicily]], and a death in his wife's family in 1194 gave him possession of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], a source of vast wealth. Henry failed to make royal and Imperial succession hereditary, but in 1196 he succeeded in gaining a pledge that his infant son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] would receive the German crown. Faced with difficulties in Italy and confident that he would realize his wishes in Germany at a later date, Henry returned to the south, where it appeared he might unify the peninsula under the Hohenstaufen name. After a series of military victories, however, he fell ill and died of natural causes in Sicily in 1197. His underage son Frederick could only succeed him in Sicily and Malta, while in the Empire the struggle between the House of Staufen and the House of Welf erupted once again.  ===Philip of Swabia=== Because the election of a three-year-old boy to be German king appeared likely to make orderly rule difficult, the boy's uncle, Duke [[Philip of Swabia]], brother of late Henry VI, was designated to serve in his place. Other factions however favoured a Welf candidate. In 1198, two rival kings were chosen: the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia and the son of the deprived Duke [[Henry the Lion]], the Welf [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]]. A long civil war began; Philip was about to win when he was murdered by the Bavarian [[count palatine]] Otto VIII of [[Wittelsbach]] in 1208. [[Pope Innocent III]] initially had supported the Welfs, but when Otto, now sole elected monarch, moved to appropriate Sicily, Innocent changed sides and accepted young Frederick II{{how|date=July 2014}} and his ally, King [[Philip II of France]], who defeated Otto at the 1214 [[Battle of Bouvines]]. Frederick had returned to Germany in 1212 from Sicily, where he had grown up, and was elected king in 1215. When Otto died in 1218, Fredrick became the undisputed ruler, and in 1220 was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Philip changed the coat of arms from a black lion on a gold shield to three leopards,<ref>{{cite book  |last=Stälin  |first=Paul Friedrich  |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |title=Geschichte Württembergs Erster Band Erste Hälfte (bis 1268)  |publisher=  |year=1882  |location=Gotha,  |pages=389–393  |url=  |doi=  |id=   |isbn=}}</ref> probably derived from the arms of his Welf rival [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]].  ==Ruling in Italy== The conflict between the Staufer dynasty and the [[House of Welf|Welf]] had irrevocably weakened the Imperial authority and the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy#Conquest of Sicily, 1061–1091|Norman kingdom of Sicily]] became the base for Staufer rule.  ===Frederick II=== Emperor Frederick II spent little time in Germany as his main concerns lay in [[Southern Italy]]. He founded the [[University of Naples]] in 1224 to train future state officials and reigned over Germany primarily through the allocation of royal prerogatives, leaving the sovereign authority and imperial estates to the ecclesiastical and secular princes. He made significant concessions to the German nobles, such as those put forth in an imperial statute of 1232, which made princes virtually independent rulers within their territories. These measures favoured the further fragmentation of the Empire. [[File:CastelDelMontePugliaItalyEurope.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frederick's [[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], in [[Andria, Italy|Andria]], Apulia, Italy.]] By the 1226 [[Golden Bull of Rimini]], Frederick had assigned the military order of the [[Teutonic Knights]] to complete the conquest and conversion of the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] lands. A reconciliation with the Welfs took place in 1235, whereby [[Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Otto the Child]], grandson of the late Saxon duke Henry the Lion, was named [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg]]. The power struggle with the popes continued and resulted in Fredrick's [[excommunication]] in 1227. In 1239, [[Pope Gregory IX]] excommunicated Fredrick again, and in 1245 he was condemned as a heretic by a church council. Although Frederick was one of the most energetic, imaginative, and capable rulers of the time, he was not concerned with drawing the disparate forces in Germany together. His legacy was thus that local rulers had more authority after his reign than before it. The clergy also had become more powerful. [[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick II with his falcon, from ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', c. 1240, [[Vatican Library]]]] By the time of Frederick's death in 1250, little centralized power remained in Germany. The Great [[Interregnum]], a period in which there were several elected rival kings, none of whom was able to achieve any position of authority, followed the death of Frederick's son King [[Conrad IV of Germany]] in 1254. The German princes vied for individual advantage and managed to strip many powers away from the diminished monarchy. Rather than establish sovereign states however, many nobles tended to look after their families. Their many male heirs created more and smaller estates, and from a largely free class of officials previously formed, many of these assumed or acquired hereditary rights to administrative and legal offices. These trends compounded political fragmentation within Germany. The period was ended in 1273 with the election of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]], a [[Godparent|godson]] of Frederick.  ===End of the Staufer dynasty === Conrad IV was succeeded as duke of Swabia by his only son, two-year-old [[Conradin]]. By this time, the office of duke of Swabia had been fully subsumed into the office of the king, and without royal authority had become meaningless. In 1261, attempts to elect young Conradin king were unsuccessful. He also had to defend Sicily against an invasion by [[Charles of Anjou]], a brother of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] king. Charles had defeated Conradin's uncle [[Manfred, King of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Benevento]] on 26 February 1266. The king himself, refusing to flee, rushed into the midst of his enemies and was killed. Conradin's campaign to retake control ended with his defeat in 1268 at the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] after which he was handed over to Charles, who had him publicly [[executed]] at [[Naples]]. With Conradin, the direct line of the Dukes of Swabia finally ceased to exist, though most of the later emperors were descended from the Staufer dynasty indirectly.  During the political decentralization of the late Staufer period, the population had grown from an estimated 8 million in 1200 to about 14 million in 1300, and the number of towns increased tenfold. The most heavily urbanized areas of Germany were located in the south and the west. Towns often developed a degree of independence, but many were subordinate to local rulers if not [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] to the emperor. Colonization of the east also continued in the thirteenth century, most notably through the efforts of the Teutonic Knights. German merchants also began trading extensively on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]].  ==Members of the Hohenstaufen family== [[File:Staufen dynasty.JPG|thumb|right|Family tree of the Hohenstaufen emperors including their relation to succeeding dynasties]]  ===Holy Roman Emperors and Kings of the Romans=== *[[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], king 1138–1152 *[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], king 1152–1190, emperor after 1155 *[[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], king 1190–1197, emperor after 1191 *[[Philip of Swabia]], king 1198–1208 *[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], king 1208–1250, emperor after 1220 *[[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry (VII)]], king 1220–1235 (under his father Emperor Frederick II) *[[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]], king 1237–1254 (until 1250 under his father Emperor Frederick II) The first ruling Hohenstaufen, Conrad III, like the last one, Conrad IV, was never crowned emperor.

film]] directed by [[Miguel Arteta]] from a screenplay written by Rob Lieber. The film stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Jennifer Garner]], and [[Ed Oxenbould]], and is loosely based on [[Judith Viorst]] and Ray Cruz's 1972 [[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day|children's book of the same name]]. Co-produced by [[Shawn Levy]] and [[Lisa Henson]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] through their respective production companies, [[21 Laps Entertainment]] and [[The Jim Henson Company]], the film was released in North America on October 10, 2014.<ref name=\"THRAug21\" /> The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing $100 million worldwide against a $28 million budget.  ==Plot== The film follows the exploits of Alexander Cooper ([[Ed Oxenbould]]), an ordinary 11-year-old boy, and his \"terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.\" He is left out by his family; his older brother, Anthony ([[Dylan Minnette]]), his older sister, Emily ([[Kerris Dorsey]]), his mother, Kelly ([[Jennifer Garner]]), his father, Ben ([[Steve Carell]]), and his baby brother, Trevor (Elise/Zoey Vargas), living in the western [[United States]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[California]].  The day before Alexander's twelfth birthday, he wakes up and finds [[Chewing gum|gum]] in his hair and clips it off with a pair of scissors. Anthony is trying to earn his [[driver's license]] so he can drive his girlfriend, Celia ([[Bella Thorne]]), to the [[prom]], Emily is rehearsing for the title role in her school play of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', Kelly is working for a [[publication company]] that is publishing a new children's book which will promote her to vice president of the company, and Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months, has landed a job interview as a [[game designer]] for a video game company.  That same morning, Alexander attends school where he experiences another series of mishaps, as well as finding out that his friends, including his crush, Becky Gibson ([[Sidney Fullmer]]), and best friend, Paul (Mekai Curtis), will all be attending the birthday party of Phillip Parker (Lincoln Melcher) instead of his, due to Philip's expensive party entertainment and popularity. He tries to tell his family how miserably his day has gone, but none of them even listen to what he says. That evening, Anthony upsets Celia during a phone call while yelling at Alexander saying he is an \"idiot brother\", and Emily rehearses her stage lines in Kelly's car while leaving its light on. Alexander makes himself a makeshift birthday [[sundae]] and wishes his family could experience the disappointments he does every day.  The next morning, Alexander wakes up to find his family in disarray and chaos erupts; his parents have overslept, Emily has a cold, and Anthony has found out that he and Celia broke up. The battery in Kelly's car is dead, because Emily left its light on all evening long while rehearsing, so Ben has to take Trevor with him to the interview after dropping Kelly off at work. At school, Paul gives Alexander good news: Philip's birthday party is cancelled as Philip has gotten the [[chicken pox]], so the kids that were originally going to attend Philip's party have now decided they will attend Alexander's party instead. Alexander calls his father, asking him to plan a party for him. Kelly is informed of an embarrassing typo in the book they are publicizing (\"dump\" instead of \"jump\"), and needs to stop [[Dick Van Dyke]] from reading it at a public reading later. Ben takes Trevor along to the office interview and meets Greg ([[Donald Glover]]) who seems impressed at his credentials, although they decide to hold another meeting after Trevor ingests a [[highlighter]]. Meanwhile at school, Anthony finds out that Celia has gotten back together with him. Feeling excited about what happened, Anthony jumps up and accidentally slaps a banner which is held up by two trophy display cases between him, causing them to fall and smash, which leads to his teacher taking him to the principal's office and suspending him.  Kelly manages to arrive at Dick Van Dyke's reading, but she is too late in trying to warn him about the book's typo. He reads it with the inappropriate material, humiliating himself and the publishing company. Meanwhile, Ben has purchased [[cough syrup]] for Emily's worsening symptoms and takes Anthony to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], where his driving instructor intentionally distracts him by convincing him to pick up his [[cell phone]], causing him to destroy several parking meters, badly damage the [[Chrysler Town & Country|family minivan]], and ultimately fail his driving exam, much to the family's dismay. Alexander confesses that the family's day was jinxed because of his ill wishes the night before, and apologizes, but Ben says \"Apology not accepted\" because they can still have some good in it. Afterwards, they all go to Emily's play, which is inadvertently sabotaged by her impaired behavior as she had gotten excessively drunk after [[overdosing]] on the cough syrup. Afterwards, the game design firm calls Ben and asks him to meet them at an \"authentic\" Japanese [[hibachi]] restaurant called Nagamaki for another meeting. The family, joined by Celia, goes to the restaurant in their badly damaged minivan, where Ben accidentally sets his shirt on fire at the grill, embarrassing him to the employers. The whole family consoles him, admitting that they will overcome whatever else the day has in store for them. Alexander states, \"You just gotta have the bad days so you can love the good days even more\", and Anthony suddenly decides not to go to the prom with Celia, stating that his family is more important, and they also break up completely.  The family returns home, and discover that Ben had hired a rental animal service to recreate an [[Australia]]n petting zoo for Alexander's birthday party. A [[crocodile]] and [[kangaroo]], however, have escaped from their cage and Ben is kicked by the kangaroo after chasing it for several blocks. They then decide to pitch in to try and salvage the day by helping host it. Ben and Kelly receive good news: he got hired for the game design job, and she has been informed that the celebrity reading went viral and has created publicity for the book. Reunited, Ben then brings out the cake, with Alexander wishing for more days like the one they shared together.  ==Cast== * [[Ed Oxenbould]] as Alexander Cooper<ref name=\"THRAug21\" /> * [[Steve Carell]] as Ben Cooper, Alexander's father<ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=68281 |title=Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Trailer, News, Videos, and Reviews |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-27}}</ref> * [[Jennifer Garner]] as Kelly Cooper, Alexander's mother<ref name=\"comingsoon1\" /> * [[Dylan Minnette]] as Anthony Cooper, Alexander's older brother<ref name=\"CSFullCast\">{{cite news|title=Full Cast Revealed for Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108320|accessdate=August 30, 2013|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> * [[Kerris Dorsey]] as Emily Cooper, Alexander's older sister<ref name=\"CSFullCast\" /> * Elise & Zoey Vargas as Trevor Cooper, Alexander's baby brother * [[Sidney Fullmer]] as Becky Gibson, Alexander's crush * [[Bella Thorne]] as Celia, Anthony's girlfriend<ref name=\"comingsoon1\" /> * [[Megan Mullally]] as Nina, Kelly's boss <ref name=\"THRCoolidgeMullally\" /> * [[Toni Trucks]] as Steph * [[Donald Glover]] as Greg<ref name=\"ComingSoon.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=118066 |title=The Trailer for Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> * Joel Johnstone as Logan<ref name=\"THRAug21\" /> * [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Ms. Suggs, Anthony's driving instructor<ref name=\"THRCoolidgeMullally\" /> * [[Samantha Logan]] as Heather<ref name=\"ComingSoon.net\" /> * [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Himself * [[Australia's Thunder from Down Under|Thunder From Down Under]] as Themselves * Mekai Curtis as Paul, Alexander's friend * Lincoln Melcher as Phillip Parker * [[Mary Mouser]] as Audrey Gibson * Reese Hartwig as Elliott Gibson * [[Martha Hackett]] as Mrs. Gibson * [[Burn Gorman]] as Mr. Brand  ==Production== In 2011, [[20th Century Fox]] had plans to make a live-action [[film adaptation]] of the book.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=Cholodenko in talks for Fox's ''Alexander''|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118036359|accessdate=October 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 3, 2011}}</ref> Written by Rob Lieber, the film was set to be directed by [[Lisa Cholodenko]] (who also made an earlier draft of the screenplay), and produced by [[Shawn Levy]] with Dan Levine for Levy's [[21 Laps Entertainment|21 Laps]] and [[Lisa Henson]] from [[The Jim Henson Company]].
